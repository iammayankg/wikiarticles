The Durban Moment refers to the period in the early 1970s when the South African city of Durban became the centre of a new vibrancy in the struggle against apartheid. The two central figures in this moment were Steve Biko and Richard Turner – the former was closely associated with the Black Consciousness Movement and the latter with the trade union movement. The two were in a reading group together. Both were influenced by the new left and had links to radical Christian circles.
