The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia (MIA, Georgian: საქართველოს შინაგან საქმეთა სამინისტრო) is a state law enforcement agency of Georgia. It is divided in several sub branches, such as the Patrol Police, the Counter Intelligence Department, the Counter Terror Center, Anti-Corruption Agency, State Security Agency (SUS), the Operative-Technical Department,the Legal Division, the Special Tasks Main Division, the General Inspections Bureau, the Central Criminal Police Department, the Security Police, the Border Police and the Police Academy.


== History ==
The Ministry of Interior was always present during the soviet rule as local administrative institution for observation and oppression of political and foreign threats. However it evolved after Georgia's independence in 1991 into a self-acting independent institution which was tasked to guarantee constitutional stability. Since then it was always engaged in conflicts or controversial events in connection to high officials but at the same time did also constantly provide force and resources for the global war on criminality and terror. The MIA was further responsible for undermining the trade with Uranium and made successful achievements in the region.
Anti terror units were or are engaged in Afghanistan since 2001 and later in Iraq in 2003-2005.
In 2005, Vladimir Arutyunian attempted to assassinate US President George W. Bush during his visit in Georgia. After the failed grenade throw at the speech of both presidents, he was caught by commandos of the Counter Terrorist Center two months later. During the operation the head of the Counterintelligence Department was shot when he was approaching the already wounded suspect.
Internal Forces were heavily engaged in the 2008 South Ossetia War, losing several police officers with many wounded, Since then MIA personnel are securing checkpoints at the conflict zone border.


=== Captured Nuclear elements ===
In 2006 Georgian intelligence captured a diversant group carrying 100 grams of 70% enriched Uranium. The group reportedly crossed from a break away region South Ossetia that is considered to be occupied by Russian forces. 4 years later in 2010 during an anti terror operation, Georgian special forces caught two ethnic Armenians carrying 16 kg of 70% enriched Uranium. Georgia blamed Russia for illegal trading of nuclear elements claiming it being the only country that is able to have 70% enriched uranium in the eastern European and Mid Eastern Districts. The quantity of Uranium was enough to construct so called dirty bomb.


== Divisions ==
The Special Tasks Main Division supports regional police forces with special units and performs various tasks to protect public order. It is the largest formation of the branch. The Special Operations Department is divided into several sub divisions, which conduct anti-terrorist and anti-criminal operations with special weapons and tactics. In addition to that, a small Special Forces unit is maintained by the ministry’s Constitutional Security Department, which protects the state from the activities of radical/extremist-minded groups and organizations.
The Special Operations Center deploys elite tactical forces responsible for anti crime and anti terroristic operations or other similar threats against the state and human rights inside and outside the Republic of Georgia. The section is classified due to its activities.
The structures intensively cooperate with the United Nations, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other international services in the sphere of sharing information concerning terrorism and legislative issues.
