Keep Left is a small Trotskyist group in South Africa which is affiliated to the International Socialist Tendency led by the Socialist Workers Party of Britain.
It was founded as the International Socialists of South Africa but underwent a split of a part of its membership. ISSA supporters then joined the South African Communist Party and began publication of Keep Left. More recently Keep Left has left the South African Communist Party and concentrates much of its work on the anti-capitalist movement. It is affiliated to the Anti-Privatisation Forum.
