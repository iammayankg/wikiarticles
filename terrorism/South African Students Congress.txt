The South African Students Congress (SASCO) is a South African student organisation which was founded in September 1991 at Rhodes University in Grahamstown, Eastern Cape, through the merger of the South African National Student Congress (SANSCO) and the National Union of South African Students (NUSAS). The predecessor of SANSCO, the Azanian Students Organisation (AZASO) was initially formed in 1979 as a continuation of the South African Students Organisation (SASO) when the latter was banned by the Apartheid government. SASO, in turn, got started by Steve Biko as a breakaway faction from NUSAS in the 1960s.
