== History ==
This 50 man force was established in the early 1980s and is broken down into two operational sections and a headquarters element. Based in Hammamet, they have responsibility for CT operations at government and diplomatic buildings, aircraft hijackings and maritime situations. In the event of a major operation, the U.S.G.N. would be reinforced by the Commandos Unit of the Garde National (National Guard's Commando Unit- U.C.G.N.).
