The Israel South Africa Agreement (ISSA) was a secret defence co-operation agreement originally signed in 1975 between Israel and the government of South Africa.
The agreement covered many different areas of defence co-operation at a time when both countries were unable to source weapons and defence technology freely on the international market, primarily because of arms embargoes in place at the time.
