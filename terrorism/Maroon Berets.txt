The Special Forces Command (Turkish: Özel Kuvvetler Komutanlığı), nicknamed Maroon Berets (Turkish: Bordo Bereliler) because of their distinctive service headgear, are a highly trained elite special operations unit of the Turkish Armed Forces made up of volunteer Turkish Army officers after graduating a roughly 4-year training period. The Special Forces Command is not aligned to any of the three Turkish branches of TAF, receiving its orders directly from the General Staff of the Republic of Turkey. Its forerunner was the Special Warfare Department (Turkish: Özel Harp Dairesi)
Although the Special Forces Command is considered a division-level formation, this includes non-combatant units and administrative duties personnel as well.


== Selection ==
Volunteers initially face a pass/fail written exam as well as physical tests. Those who pass the exams become special forces candidates. Adequate linguistic skills in at least one foreign language is a plus for admission. The candidates then have to complete a challenging training period which lasts around 3.5-5 years. Many drop out during this intense training period. Training encompasses fitness, obstacle, Martial Arts, close quarters combat (CQC), biological/chemical/nuclear warfare, parachuting, diving, sniping, demolition, counter-terrorism, search and rescue, stealth seek and destroy, reconnaissance and survival. Learning foreign languages is a part of the training. During the training, candidates are pushed by their instructors to their limits, both physically and mentally. Training schedule includes all aspects of a modern-day regular and psychological warfare. 100 kilometer terrain-walking with a 40 kg. load is an example of what the candidates have to go through during training.
The Trust Shot (in Turkish "Gūven Atışı") is a part of the MB's training program. It is exercised on the last month of the training and is to ensure that the soldiers can trust each other with their lives. The Trust Shot consists of two members of a squad standing next to paper target boards, while another member fires on the targets with a handgun while walking towards them from 15 meters (49 feet) away. During the exercise the men standing next to the targets are not allowed to move or wear body armor. They are one of the few special operations teams in the world to perform the trust shot.


== MAK ==
Within the OKK, there is a more specialized unit, the name of the unit is Combat Search and Rescue (Muharebe Arama Kurtarma – M.A.K.), its duties focus more on rescue of TSK members who stay behind the enemy lines, MAK can conduct attack on enemy at the same time. No further information is available on MAK except for the fact that it is thought to be established and organized like its US counterpart Pararescue. Its members are selected from the OKK. It should not be difficult to conclude that the MAK members are the best of the best within the Turkish Armed Forces.


== Special Aviation Group ==
Special Aviation Group provides helicopter support for command's missions. The helicopters have been modernized and can operate in night/day, integrated and in sync.
There is no clear information about fixed wing planes in the Group but its believed that there are planes too. In 2001, a CN235 crashed in Malatya and 34 soldiers lost their lives. That plane was belonged to Special Aviation Group. 


== Activities ==
In 2012 a parliamentary report said that the Special Forces Command, along with its predecessors, had trained hundreds of thousands of civilians and equipped them with weapons, which they used to commit murders of Kurdish civilians as part of the Kurdish-Turkish conflict in the 1990s. The report said that the Special Forces Command's archives at its headquarters, nicknamed the "cosmic room", held "the secret history of Turkey".
