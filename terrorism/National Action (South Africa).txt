The National Action (more commonly known by its Afrikaans name, Nasionale Aksie) was a short-lived South African political party formed by Cassie Aucamp when he left the Afrikaner Eenheids Beweging (AEB) in the 2003 floor-crossing window. The AEB, along with other Afrikaner parties, was merging into the Freedom Front Plus to contest the 2004 elections but the National Action, claiming to support Afrikaner interests, remained separate, and competed in the 2004 elections. It won no seats in the National Assembly of South Africa or any of the provincial legislatures. It did not contest the 2009 elections.
