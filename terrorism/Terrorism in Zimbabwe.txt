Chimwenje was a militant group active on the border of Zimbabwe and Mozambique. The group was allegedly trained by RENAMO guerrillas, and was led by Armando Mabache.
In 1996, Zimbabwean opposition leader Ndabaningi Sithole was arrested following an alleged fall 1995 assassination attempt on President Robert Mugabe by Chimwenje. When interviewed, Sithole stated that the members of Chimwenje were not evil, but people who want to come back to their country.
