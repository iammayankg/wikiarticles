Swart gevaar (Afrikaans for "black threat") was a term used during apartheid in South Africa to refer to the perceived security threat of the majority black African population to the white South African government.
In the early days of post-apartheid South Africa, the term was expanded to refer to a cultural '"black threat", in which many white Afrikaners feared their culture would be lost if they were assimilated to a multiracial society.
