The politics of the Northern Cape is dominated by the African National Congress (ANC), but their position has not been as strong as in many other provinces of South Africa.
In the election of 1994, no party achieved an absolute majority in the province, with the ANC having a plurality of 49% of the votes and 15 seats. The National Party had 40% of the votes and 12 seats, the right wing Freedom Front 2 seats and the liberal Democratic Party 1 seat. However, the ANC was in a Government of National Unity with the NP at the national level, and attained the premiership by virtue of its plurality in the Assembly. Manne Dipico of the ANC became the first Premier of the Northern Cape.
With the decline of the National Party, the ANC increased its voter share in later elections and has remained firmly in charge of the province. Dipuo Peters replaced Dipico as Premier in 2004. The official opposition in the Northern Cape after the 2004 elections was the Democratic Alliance (DA), which received 11% of the vote in the provincial ballot. The opposition's hopes of unseating the ANC has not had any success, even with the Congress of the People helping to split the vote in the election of 22 April 2009. Hazel Jenkins became Premier following the election, and COPE became the official opposition.
The 2014 election saw the ANC returned to power once again with an increased mandate, while DA once again became official opposition, following the collapse of COPE.
The ANC enjoys the greatest support in the densely populated and Tswana dominated northern districts, but has faced stronger challenges in the more thinly populated Afrikaans speaking Karoo areas adjoining the DA dominated Western Cape. They currently govern 23 of the 27 local municipalities in the Northern Cape.
