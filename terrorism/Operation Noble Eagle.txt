Operation Noble Eagle (ONE) is the name given to the United States and Canadian military operations related to homeland security and support to federal, state, and local agencies. The operation began 14 September 2001, in response to the September 11 attacks.


== History ==
Operation Noble Eagle began with the mobilization of thousands of National Guard and reserve personnel to perform security missions on military installations, airports and other potential targets such as bridges, power plants, and port facilities. These reservists were called to active duty under a mobilization authority known as a partial mobilization (10 USC 12302). In a time of national emergency declared by the President, partial mobilization authorizes the President to order members of the ready reserve to active duty for a period not to exceed 24 consecutive months. Operation Noble Eagle was the most recent activation of Operation Garden Plot, a plan which was developed to provide military assistance to civil authorities during times of major civil disturbances. Additionally, in 2001 and 2002, thousands of members of the national guard were activated at the order of their respective governors to provide additional security at airports. They were called up under Title 32 of the U.S. Code, which means they were under state control, but with federal pay and benefits. The Royal Canadian Air Force assisted in providing defense of the northern border of the United States. The United States Army's 759th Military Police Battalion, 144th Military Police Company and the 177th Military Police Brigade were assigned the task of protecting the White House, the Pentagon and the Capitol.


=== Requirement ===
United States civilian and military leaders are beginning to regard the costly air defense operation above North American cities as a permanent defense requirement demanding significant attention from NORAD. The current focus is on improving command and control of the homeland air defense mission.


== Equipment ==
The United States Department of Defense provided F-15 Eagles and F-16 Fighting Falcons to this operation, and the Canadian Forces provided CF-18s.


== Canadian NORAD Region ==

As the Canadian geographical component of NORAD, CANR provides airspace surveillance and control, and directs all air sovereignty activities for the Canadian NORAD Region. CANR and its assigned Air Force assets throughout the country ensure air safety and security against potential air threats and have supported special events such as the G-8 Summit and the visits of foreign dignitaries.
The Canadian NORAD Region (CANR) flew Operation Noble Eagle (ONE) air defense protection missions in the Windsor, Ontario/Detroit, Michigan area on 5 February 2006, in support of Super Bowl XL at Ford Field. These types of missions had become more common at organized entertainment such as the Super Bowl.
