The Group Areas Development Act, 1955 (Act No. 69 of 1955; subsequently renamed the Community Development Act, 1955), formed part of the apartheid system of racial segregation in South Africa. It was enacted to help effect the purpose of the Group Areas Act of 1950, namely to exclude non-Whites from living in the most developed areas, which were restricted to Whites. It was later replaced by the Community Development Act of 1966.
