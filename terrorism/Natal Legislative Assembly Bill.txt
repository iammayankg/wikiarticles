The Natives Legislative Assembly Bill of 1894, formed part of the apartheid system of racial segregation in South Africa.
This legislation sought to deprive Indians in Natal of the parliamentary vote. The bill was opposed by Mahatma Gandhi of India, who submitted a petition signed by 10,000 Indians to the Natal Government. Though unsuccessful to prevent the legislation from being passed eventually it is believed that this bill led to Gandhi establishing the Natal Indian Congress to protect the rights of Indians in South Africa. This created awareness of the racial discrimination towards South Africa Indians around the world.
As a consequence of legislation following this bill, the Indians living in the Natal region were removed of their rights to vote in the region.
