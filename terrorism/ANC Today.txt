ANC Today is a weekly web-based newsletter published by the African National Congress (ANC). It consists mainly of updates on current programmes and initiatives of the ANC. It is one of the few major online publications from an African political party.
In 2001, the ANC launched an online party newspaper ANC Today â€“ Online Voice of the African National Congress to offset the bias of the white-controlled press.
