Kommandokorps is an Afrikaner survivalist group active in South Africa. The leader is Kol.Franz Jooste, who served with the South African Defence Force during the apartheid era.
The group organises paramilitary camps, which are attended by youths between the ages of 13 and 19. The teenagers are taught self-defence and how to combat a perceived black enemy. Following an infantry-style curriculum, they are lectured on racial differences, such as a claim that black people had a smaller cerebral cortex than whites, and are made to use a modern South African flag as a doormat. The camp is located in the veld outside the town of Carolina, Mpumalanga, about 230 km east of Johannesburg.
The group has been criticised by the Afrikaner lobby group AfriForum. The Democratic Alliance called for the group to be closed, and its activities investigated by the Human Rights Commission. A group of Kommandokorps volunteers attended the funeral of the former Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging leader Eugene Terreblanche. In 2011, the group signed a saamstaanverdrag (unity pact) with the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging and the Suidlanders, a large whites-only group.
“Fatherland” is a full-length documentary produced and directed by Tarryn Lee Crossman that explores the experiences of young men in the Kommandokorps camps.
