The Detachment Jala Mangkara (English: Detachment of Deadly Ocean) or Denjaka is an elite special operations forces of the Indonesian Navy. It is a combined detachment formed from selected personnel of the Navy's Frogmen Unit (KOPASKA) and the Marine Corps' Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion (Batalyon Intai Amfibi/Yontaifib).
The unit was formed in 1984 by the Chief of the Indonesian Armed Forces to counter maritime strategic threats including, but not limited to, terrorism and sabotage. Despite the specific reason for its formation, as in the case of any other special operations forces around the world, the detachment is also fully trained in conducting reconnaissance, unconventional warfare, and clandestine behind-enemy-lines operations.

On 4 November 1982, the Navy chief of staff issued a decree (No. Skep/2848/XI/1982) forming a task force called "Naval Special Forces (Pasusla)" to fulfill the need for a maritime special operations forces capable of countering terrorism and sabotage. In the initial phase, 70 personnel from the Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion and Underwater Special Unit (or Navy frogmen) were recruited to form Pasusla. Training for this new unit was under the command of the Western Fleet commander with assistance from the commandant of the Marine Corps, while the Navy chief of staff acted as the operational commander of Pasusla. The unit was based at Western Fleet Command Headquarters, Jakarta.

Upon further development of this unit, on 13 November 1984, the Navy chief of staff requested the chief of the Indonesian armed forces to form Denjaka, which was approved and, through the issuance of an approval letter (No. R/39/08/9/2/SPN), Pasusla changed into Denjaka and was designated as a Naval counter-terrorism detachment.
