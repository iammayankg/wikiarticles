African nationalism is a political movement for Pan-Africanism and for national self-determination. Origins of the idea come from European nationalist schools of thought. Political interest began in the 1870s and political organizations started to form in the 1890s. African Nationalism came to mean the struggle against foreign colonial powers ruling over African territory. In the years after World War II, African nationalism gained strength, resulting in independence for Libya in 1951 and Ghana in 1957. All but six African countries were independent nation-states by 1966. Later after many successful nationalist movements in Africa, "African Nationalism" began to be associated with the Pan-African movement.  Edward Wilmot Blyden has been described as the founder of African nationalism. Julius Nyerere defined African nationalism as a new kind of nationalism and that it is "meaningless, dangerous, is anachronistic if it is not at the same time pan-Africanism."
