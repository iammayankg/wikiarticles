The Vry Afrikaner Beweging (English: Free Afrikaner Movement) is an independent freedom movement focusing on activism, economic development and job creation in order to establish a peaceful solution for the Afrikaner people's current detrimental situation in southern Africa. Vry Afrikaner forms part of a broader network of organisations working towards greater Afrikaner self-determination in a region between Orania and the West Coast of the Northern Cape province of South Africa.
The goal is to create an independent Afrikaner Republic where Afrikaners can be free to protect, develop and empower their language, culture and interests. The term Vry Afrikaner also describes any Afrikaner individual that actively pursues Afrikaner freedom on any domain.
