The Philippine National Police (Filipino: Pambansang Pulisya ng Pilipinas and abbreviated as PNP) is the armed civilian national police force of the Philippines.
The PNP was formed on January 29, 1991 when the Philippine Constabulary and the Integrated National Police were merged pursuant to Republic Act 6975, or the Department of the Interior and Local Government Act of 1990. It is part of the Department of the Interior and Local Government. Its national headquarters is at Camp Crame in Quezon City, Metro Manila, and it has 160,000 personnel.
It is administered and controlled by the National Police Commission.


== History ==
The common history of the police forces of the Philippines can be traced during the reigns of the pre-Hispanic lakans, datus and sultans in the islands, where the soldiers who served in the communities where the people lived (and which reported directly to local leaders) also performed the enforcement of local laws. All changed with the arrival of the Spaniards and the introduction of Western law to the archipelago, and until 1868, personnel of the Spanish Army and local militias were also tasked with policing duties in local communities. On that year, the local branch of the Civil Guard was officially established by order of then Governor-General Carlos María de la Torre y Nava Cerrada. Starting from a single division, during the Revolutionary period it grew into a corps of military police with detachments in Luzon and the Visayas, and was notorious for its abuses against the Filipinos. (These abuses were mentioned in José Rizal's two novels, Noli Me Tángere and El filibusterismo, both referring to several cases of Civil Guardsmen abusing the local populace.)
With the beginning of American rule and the Philippine-American War, the Philippine Constabulary was raised in 1901 as the national gendarmerie force for law enforcement, directly reporting to the American government. At the same time, what is now the Manila Police District came into existence as the nation's first city police force.
Passed on December 13, 1990, Republic Act No. 6975, the Department of the Interior and Local Government Act of 1990, ordered the merger of both the Philippine Constabulary and the Integrated National Police and gave birth to the creation of the Philippine National Police. R.A. 6975 was further amended by R.A. 8551, the Philippine National Police Reform and Reorganization Act of 1998, and by R.A. 9708. The R.A. 8551 envisioned the PNP to be a community- and service-oriented agency.

=== "Wheel of Torture" secret detention facility ===
The Philippine Commission on Human Rights filed charges against ten police officers after it was discovered that they routinely tortured detainees inside a secret detention facility in Biñan, Laguna. The facility was maintained by the PNP Provincial Intelligence Branch (PIB) to extract confessions or information from detainees, or to extort money from them in exchange for being charged with lighter offenses or the dropping of the charges altogether. It was also alleged that some "were tortured for the police officers’ amusement" when they're intoxicated. The facility is notorious for utilizing a roulette called the "Wheel of Torture", a modified version of the "Wheel of Fortune", where various torture methods were printed. The wheel is rotated and wherever the pin stops, the indicated torture method is perpetrated on the detainee.
The torture methods included, a 20-second Manny Pacman punch, named after the famous boxer Manny Pacquiao, where the detainee is beaten for 20 seconds; "Paniki" which means being hung like a bat; "Tusok ulo ka" which means being pierced through the head; "Zombies" which means being electrocuted; and other degrading tasks like "duck walk" and "Ferris wheel".
