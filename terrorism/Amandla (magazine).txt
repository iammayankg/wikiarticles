Amandla! is a South African bi-monthly magazine that was launched in 2006. The founders are Mazibuko K. Jara, and Brian Ashley. The magazine is published by the Alternative Information and Development Centre (AIDC) and provides coverage and analysis of current political, economic and social processes from a radical left perspective. Coverage is given to issues such as climate change, labour, food sovereignty and national healthcare while adding to debates around South Africaâ€™s social movements and popular organizations. The magazine takes its name from the Zulu word amandla, which means power.
The magazine's articles offer perspectives on alternative strategies to deepen the process of social transformation in South Africa and on the African continent. Issues have included the Eskom electricity crisis in South Africa, critiques of the property taxation system, international news from Thailand and the crisis in Greece.
The magazine is written by, and for activists in political, labour and popular organisations, as well as progressive intellectuals at the universities, in NGOs, parliament, community-based organisations, churches, journalists, lawyers, public officials in state institutions, etc. Contributors thus far have included Noam Chomsky, Jeremy Cronin, Rob Davies, Ronnie Kasrils, Mark Heywood and Joel Netshitenzhe.
