Rooi gevaar is an Afrikaans phrase, translated into English as the "red threat" or "communist threat". The term was used during apartheid in South Africa for what was seen as a security threat to the then white South African government from communist forces. The Soviet Union and Cuba supported various insurgency groups (mostly black) in sub-Saharan Africa. The struggle came to a head in the Angolan Civil War with Cuban and South African forces involved in the fighting. The term diminished in use after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
