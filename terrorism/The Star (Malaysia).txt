== History ==
The daily newspaper was first published on 9 September 1971 as a regional newspaper based in Penang. The STAR went into national circulation on 3 January 1976 when it set up its new office in Kuala Lumpur. In 1978, the newspaper headquarters was relocated to Kuala Lumpur. The Star continues to expand its wings over the years. In 1981, it moved its headquarters from Kuala Lumpur to Petaling Jaya which is also its current premise to accommodate a growing number of staff and technology devices.
In 1987, The Star was one of the newspapers whose publication licences were withdrawn in Operation Lalang. It resumed publication five months later in March 1988, but after its return, The Star lost its previous 'liberal flavour'.

The Star (daily) and Sunday Star are published in five editions â€“ two editions which cover the northern peninsular states of Penang, Kedah, Perlis, Kelantan and northern Perak, while another two editions cover the rest of the country. As of March 2010, the newspaper has a separate Sarawak edition priced at RM1.20.
