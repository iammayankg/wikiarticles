The Special State Protection Service of Georgia (SSPS) (Georgian: საქართველოს სახელმწიფო დაცვის სპეციალური სამსახური [სდსს], sakartvelos sakhelmtsipo datsvis spetsialuri samsakhuri) is a militarized government agency of Georgia tasked with the protection of several, mandated by the relevant law, high-ranking state officials, including the President of Georgia, as well as certain national properties, high-ranking foreign visitors and diplomatic offices. It is mostly subordinated to the Parliament of Georgia, with only the part responsible for the incumbent president's security being under the authority of the President of Georgia.


== History ==
The predecessor of the Special State Protection Service was the Government Protective Service of the Republic of Georgia (საქართველოს რესპუბლიკის სამთავრობო დაცვის სამსახური) formed on June 23 1994 on the basis of the Government Protective Directorate of the Ministry of State Security of Georgia. On February 20, 1996 the agency adopted the current name in line with the "Law of Georgia on Special State Protection Service".
In 1998, the SSPS was further tasked with providing security to the ongoing energy projects in Georgia, such as the Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline. This function was transferred to the Main Division for Protection of Strategic Pipelines of the Ministry of Internal Affairs on January 1, 2006.
The agency has lost 7 personnel in the line of duty. Of these, two were killed in the attack on the then-President Eduard Shevardnadze's motorcade in Tbilisi on February 9, 1998.
