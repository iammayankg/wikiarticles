Conservative terrorism is a type of terrorism, associated with state loyal terrorism, that is carried out by militants intending to eliminate threats which they believe should have been eliminated by a state's security forces. A conservative terrorist group is one which uses terrorism in order to defend the existing order or to gain a reversion to an earlier arrangement.

RAND analysts Kim Cragin and Sara Daly believe that left-wing groups are also "more likely to allow women to fight and take on operation roles as a reflection of societies' expectation of women's roles in general."
Groups described as conservative terrorist organizations include a number of organizations formed to supposedly combat communists in Colombia and the pro-British groups in Northern Ireland.
The Contras, a conservative terrorist group, were supplied with weapons by the United States in order to fight the leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua.
