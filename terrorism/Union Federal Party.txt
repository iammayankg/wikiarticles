The Union Federal Party (Afrikaans: Verenigde Federale Party) broke away from the United Party in 1953. It was a British diaspora party, committed to retaining links with the British Commonwealth and monarchy. It also wished to explore liberalising the non-white franchise. It never gained any seats in Parliament, and ceased to exist in 1960.
It was founded by members of Torch Commando
