The Non-European Unity Movement (NEUM) was a Trotskyist organisation formed in South Africa in 1943.
It was committed to non-racialism and its primary tactic was one of non-collaboration with the apartheid regime. The movement split in 1957, with both splinter organisations going into decline shortly thereafter. Both were revived in the 1980s, but have had little political influence since.
