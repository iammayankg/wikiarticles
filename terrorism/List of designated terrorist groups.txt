This is a list of designated terrorist groups by national governments, former governments and inter-governmental organizations, where the proscription has a significant effect on the group's activities. Many organizations that are accused of being a terrorist organization deny using terrorism as a military tactic to achieve their goals, and there is no international consensus on the legal definition of terrorism.
This listing does not include unaffiliated individuals accused of terrorism, which are considered under lone wolf terrorism. This list also excludes groups that might be widely considered terrorist, but who are not officially so designated according to the criteria specified above.
This list is not all inclusive. For more inclusive lists, including people, entities (corporations), and specific vehicles, refer to lists under Process of designation.


== Organizations currently officially designated as terrorist by various governments ==
The list includes references to organisations associated with Al-Qaeda by the United Nations.


== Organizations officially designated as terrorist in the past ==
Below is the list of organizations that have officially been designated as terrorist in the past, by the respective parties, but have since been delisted.


== Process of designation ==
Among the countries that publish a list of designated terrorist organizations, some have a clear established procedure for listing and delisting, and some are opaque. The Berghof Foundation argues that opaque delisting conditions reduce the incentive for the organization to abandon terrorism, while fueling radicalism.


=== Australia ===

Since 2002, the Australian Government maintains a Listing of terrorist organizations as per the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2002. Listing, de-listing and re-listing follows a protocol that mainly involves the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and the Attorney-General's Department.


=== Canada ===
Since December 18, 2001, section 83.05 of the Canadian Criminal Code allows the Governor in Council to maintain a list of entities that are engaged in terrorism, facilitating it, or acting on behalf of such an entity.
Entities are reviewed by the Minister and the Chief Justice of the Federal Court, and finally published in the Canada Gazette. The list is also published on the website of Public Safety Canada.


=== European Union ===
The European Union has two lists of designated terrorist organisations that provide for different sanctions for the two groups. The first list is copied from the United Nations, and the second is an autonomous list.


==== Autonomous list ====
All other designated organizations.
the freezing of all funds, other financial assets and economic resources.
a ban on directly or indirectly making funds, other financial assets and economic resources available.
It is important to note that sanctions are only applicable to EU-external groups regardless of designation. For example, 47 groups are listed as terrorist organizations in the EU but sanctions are only applied to 27 of these. Member States do have an obligation to assist each other in preventing and combating terrorist acts but this is the only action that follows from the designation of an EU-internal organization.

==== Listing process ====
New organizations are added to the autonomous list following this process:
"Designation": Member states and third party states tips about an organization. This state must have solid evidence and must the tip must be sent by the national authority.
Scrutinity: The Presidency, or a delegation, gathers basic information, and might require more information from the tipping state.
Consultations: Information is shared with other member states for discussion. Everything is still confidential. 15 days after, delegates of the states meet as the CP 931 Working Party, Europol is sometimes invited too.
Recommendation: The CP 931 Working Party prepares the listing decision.
Decision by EU Council: The council adopts the list. The decision must be unanimous, which means that every state has a veto right.
Official Publishing: In the EU Official Journal
Notification and Statement of Reason: The council secretariat notifies each designated organization via mail, together with instructions on how to get the decision to be reconsidered.
