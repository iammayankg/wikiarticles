The Extension of University Education Act, Act 45 of 1959, formed part of the apartheid system of racial segregation in South Africa. This act made it a criminal offense for a non-white student to register at a formerly open university without the written permission of the Minister of Internal Affairs. New universities were established for the various non-white groups. In the Western Cape, a school in Bellville was established for coloureds, while a school at Ngoye was created in Zululand for Zulus. For Indians, a school was established at Durban in Natal Province, at Turfloop in the Transvaal for the Sotho-Tswanans, while Fort Hare, the former Lovedale Mission College, became restricted for Xhosas.
The act was repealed by the Tertiary Education Act, 1988.
