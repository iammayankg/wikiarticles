This page refers to the 21st century organisation. For the political party formed in 1881 by Rev S.J. du Toit, see Afrikaner Bond.
The Afrikanerbond (Afrikaner League), established in 1994, is the successor to the Afrikaner Broederbond, formerly a South African secret society. Unlike its predecessor, membership is open to anyone over the age of 18 years who identifies with the Afrikaner community. Applicants are required to go through a selection process before membership is granted. The existence of the organisation is no longer cloaked in secrecy, it now has its own website.
The Afrikanerbond acts in the interest of Afrikaners who are committed to South Africa and want to positively contribute to the creation of a successful South Africa, which provides opportunities for all South Africans. The Afrikanerbond is therefore involved in:
the protection and promotion of fundamental rights,
protection of constitutional democracy
the promotion of responsible citizenship and patriotism.
