Terrorism in Sudan is one of the important problems of the state of Sudan. The country, which was devastating by a never-ending war, is a good place for terrorists to recruit. Sudanese government wanted to fight against terrorism in the country.
Sudan has made progress in shutting down terrorism inside its borders. Sudanâ€™s terrorist connection is not new and the country has been on the United States list of state sponsors of terrorism since August 1993. Sudan has been under diplomatic sanctions by the United Nations since 1996.
Sudan is in a strategic position to export its Islamic revolution because of its borders with both Egypt and Libya and with six African countries, including Ethiopia, which has a large and impoverished Muslim population.
Terrorism was introduced to Sudan in the early 1990s when Osama Bin Ladin and his followers came to the country and built a training camp infrastructure as well as setting up a business and finance network.


== Terrorist groups in Sudan ==
Sudan provide military training and support to Hezbollah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Egyptian Islamic Jihad, Algeria's Armed Islamic Group, and regional Islamic and non-Islamic opposition and groups in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Uganda and Tunisia. In addition, hundreds of Iranian Revolutionary Guards are sent to terrorist training camps in Sudan to train in the subversion of moderate Arab regimes.
One of the most secretive terrorist groups in Sudan is the SPLA, which uses terrorist methods in their fight for autonomy. In 2001, the SPLA escalated its campaign and attacked civilian oil targets, murdering a significant number of civilians and aid workers, as well selling rockets to civilians.


== Training camps ==
Many of the terrorist groups have a number of training camps in the country. Sudan, being the third largest African country (after the secession of South Sudan in 2011) is a common place to hide a terrorist training center. Certain locations are known for training particular groups or people from certain countries. Camp al-Maokil near Shandy was for training Algerians and Tunisians. In early May 1990, some 60 Arabs from North Africa, France, and Belgium began to train in the Shambat district of Khartoum. In the al-Khalafiyya area north of Khartoum training took place for the Algerian Islamic Salvation Army and the Armed Islamic Group. In Akhil al-Awliya on the banks of the Blue Nile, south of Khartoum more than 500 Palestinians, Syrians and Jordanians were trained.
