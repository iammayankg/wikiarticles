The Special Rapid Response Unit or SOBR (Russian – специальные отряды быстрого реагирования = Spetsial'nye Otryady Bystrogo Reagirovaniya, literally "Special Quick-Reaction Units"), comprises a spetsnaz unit of the Russian Interior Ministry (MVD). SOBR also continues to exist in Belarus, headed there as of 2006 by Dmitri Pavlichenko.
Russian SOBR units, staffed by senior-ranking police officers, receive better training than the members of OMON (which is a cross between riot police and paramilitary police). They carry out SWAT-type special operations under the jurisdiction of the MVD, including the apprehension of dangerous criminals, high-profile raids, etc. They also fought during the wars in Chechnya. In 2007 Russia had 87 OMSN units, counting over 5,000 officers stationed in major Russian cities, such as OMSN "Rys" (English OMSN "Lynx", Russian ОМСН "Рысь").
Russia's SOBR units first formed on February 10, 1992 within the Directorate for Combating Organized Crime under the MVD. On September 16, 2002, the SOBR was in the process of being dissolved and the SOBR units were reclassified as OMSN and subordinated to the regional criminal police offices. Due to the popularity of the name, and because of the similarities between SOBR and OMSN, both officers and civilians usually referred to the OMSN as "SOBR". Since the 2011 establishment of the SKR, the Investigative Committee of Russia, the unit is cooperating with the Federal investigative authorities. The units got back their historic name, "SOBR", as a part of the Ministry of the Interior reform late in 2011.
