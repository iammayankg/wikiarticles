The Counter-Terrorist Unit (Serbian: Против Tерористичка Jединица, ПTJ / Protiv Teroristička Jedinica, PTJ) is the special operations and tactical unit of the Serbian Police.
As its name states, the PTJ is oriented towards anti-terror operations as well as securing and maintaining the internal security of Serbia. Often only used in operations deemed too dangerous for other police units, it is highly trained and equipped. The PTJ's responsibilities include: resolving hostage situations, anti-terrorist operations, high profile arrests and bomb disposal. Members of the PTJ operate with extreme professionalism and devotion to their responsibilities. This has earned the PTJ great respect throughout the world as an elite special operations police unit among other such units.
