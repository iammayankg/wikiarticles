Salafia Jihadia is an Islamic terrorist organization affiliated with Al Qaeda that is active in North Africa and Spain.
Eleven suspected members of the organization were arrested in Ceuta in December 2006. Judge Baltasar Garz√≥n, a high court judge in Spain, released four of the suspects, but had the other four imprisoned in Madrid pending trial.
The organisation is suspected of responsibility for four coordinated bombing attacks on 16 May 2003 in Casablanca. 33 were killed, plus the 12 suicide bombers for 45 total, and over 100 people injured.
