The Naval Special Operations Group (NAVSOG) (also referred as the Philippine Navy SEALs) is the smallest elite unit of the Philippine Navy trained in special operations, sabotage, psychological and unconventional warfare which is heavily influenced by the United States Navy SEALs. It specializes in SEa, Air, Land (SEAL) operations ranging from reconnaissance, close combat, demolition, intelligence and underwater operations in support of overall naval operations. The unit gained prominence in a number of counter-terrorism operations, most notably against the Abu Sayyaf Group, and is known for its highly-demanding physical training program which is based on the United States Navy SEAL program. The NAVSOG training program is known as Basic Naval Special Operations Course (BNSOC). The program is physically and mentally demanding and is regarded as one of the toughest military selection programs in the entire Philippine military. Candidates have to swim two miles and run 10 kilometers every day. Furthermore, they must swim 27 kilometers from Roxas Boulevard in Manila to Naval Station Sangley Point without any rest. They also undergo "Hell Week," which is the most demanding weeks of NAVSOG training. Candidates have to carry out demanding physical team events with their boat crews with as little as a couple of hours sleep for the entire week. In one BNSOC class, only 21 students remained from 79 applicants who originally started the NAVSOG training program.


== History and organization ==

The predecessor unit to the NSWG/SWAG (the Underwater Operations Team or UOT) was activated on 5 November 1956 as a special forces of the Philippine Navy. Patterned after the US Navy Underwater Demolition Teams and the Italian Decima Flottiglia MAS with modifications for Philippine conditions, from its founding the UOT was charged with conducting underwater operations in waterways, beach areas and harbors in support of Philippine naval operations. These operations included underwater explosive disposal, mine countermeasures, salvage and search and rescue. In 1959 the UOT was expanded and redesignated the Underwater Operations Unit, then as the Underwater Operations Group (UOG).
The UOG was then renamed the Naval Special Warfare Group, and later on as the Naval Special Operations Group. The unit's tasks were also expanded to cover all facets of unconventional warfare in a maritime and riverine environment. This includes but is not limited to demolition, hostage rescue, harassment, force protection and maritime tactical operations.

Today, the Naval Special Operations Group is headquartered at Sangley Point, Cavite City. It has eight units located across the Philippines, from Naval Station San Vicente in the north to Naval Station Zamboanga in the south. Each unit is attached either to a task force or a naval force and has a complement that varies from 3 to 6 SEAL Teams, with each team consisting of an officer and seven enlisted men. All team members "…are trained tactical divers, parachutists and demolitionists and in the execution of Special Warfare Operations from the Sea, Air and Land.” To become a qualified Philippine Navy SEAL, officers and enlisted men must successfully complete the six-month Basic Naval Special Warfare/SEAL Course.


== United States influence ==
There are similarities between the Philippine Naval Special Warfare Group and the U.S. Naval Special Warfare Command. Filipino NSWG/SWAG operators are trained and operate in a manner similar to the U.S. Navy SEALs. The Filipino SEALs (actually called SWGs or SWAGs) also wear a trident similar to their U.S. Navy counterparts.
The Filipino counterpart of the U.S. counterterrorist United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU) is the Special Reaction Group (SRG), which operates under the direction of Naval Intelligence.

The best NSWG/SWAG frequently train and operates with their American counterparts and their naval brethren, the Philippine Marines.
