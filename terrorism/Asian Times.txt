Asia Times Online (abbreviated as ATol, chines. 亞洲時報在線) is a Hong Kong/Thailand-based bilingual English‒Chinese, Internet-based newspaper covering geopolitics, politics, economics, and business "from an Asian perspective". Asia Times Online was created in 1999 and sees itself as the successor to Sondhi Limthongkul's Asia Times that closed in 1997.
Asia Times Online came under new ownership and management on March 14, 2015.
Asia Times Online is now known as "Asia Times" or "AT", and has dropped the "Online" part of its name.
The new publisher is Asia Times Holdings Limited, incorporated and duly registered in Hong Kong. It derives part of its revenues from advertising, and from the resale of original content to other publications and news services.
The site offers news and commentary by distinguished correspondents and analysts across the whole spectrum of Asian issues and the global issues that intersect with them. As the successor to the Asia Times newspaper, it draws on a generation of editorial experience and an extensive network of contributors.


== Creation ==
Asia Times Online was created early in 1999 as a successor in "publication policy and editorial outlook" to the Hong Kong/Bangkok-based daily printed newspaper Asia Times, owned by Thai media mogul and leader of the People's Alliance for Democracy Sondhi Limthongkul. The newspaper closed in mid-1997, shortly after the devaluation of Thailand's baht kicked off the Asian financial crisis.


== Readership ==
Asia Times (atimes.com) averages 90,000 unique readers every day and is one of Asia's most popular news sites. The New York Times described Asia Times Online as "one of the most prominent of the [English-language] regional publications" covering Asia.
