The Elite Punjab Police, also known as the "Elite Force" or "Police Commandos", is a branch of the Punjab Police specializing in Counter-Terrorist operations and VIP security duties, as well as acting against serious crime and performing high-risk operations which can't be carried out by the regular police. It was formed in 1998 as a counterterrorism unit, but over time its duties expanded to VIP escort.

The Elite Force was created on the order of the then Punjab Chief Minister Shabaz Sarhif in 1997â€“1998. In 2004, more funds were allocated for its expansion, and 5000 new personnel were inducted. New checkpoints for curbing street crime were created across Punjab and manned by the Elite Force. Their work drew attention in the wake of the 2009 attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team in Lahore,name= The Elite Police were also extensively involved in neutralizing enemy combatants who had laid siege to the Manawan Police Training School during the 2009 Lahore police academy attacks.
