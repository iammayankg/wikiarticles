The Natal Indian Congress was an organization that aimed to fight discrimination against Indians in South Africa. The Natal Indian Congress was started by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, later known as the Mahatma. A constitution was put in place on 22 August 1894.
During its formative years, the NIC introduced many early petitions for changes to proposed discrimatory legislations.
It later allied itself with the African National Congress.
