Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for the Home Department (Home Secretary) is a senior official as one of the Great Offices of State within Her Majesty's Government and head of the Home Office. The office is a British Cabinet level position.
The Home Secretary is responsible for the internal affairs of England and Wales, and for immigration and citizenship for the United Kingdom. The remit of the Home Office also includes policing in England and Wales and matters of national security, as the Security Service, MI5, is directly accountable to the Home Secretary. Formerly, the Home Secretary was the minister responsible for prisons and probation in England and Wales; however, in 2005 those responsibilities were transferred to the newly created Ministry of Justice under the Lord Chancellor.
The current Home Secretary is The Rt Honourable Theresa May, MP, appointed on 12 May 2010 by Queen Elizabeth II on the advice of the Prime Minister, David Cameron, to serve in the Conservative-Liberal Democratic coalition government. May was reappointed by Cameron on 8 May 2015 to serve as Home Secretary in the Conservative government.
