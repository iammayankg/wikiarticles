The following is a summary of the use of capital punishment by country.


== Global overview ==

Historically, capital punishment has been used in almost every part of the world. Currently, the large majority of countries have either abolished or discontinued the practice. The use of capital punishment is usually divided into the four categories set out below. As of July 2015, of the 196 independent states that are UN members or have UN observer status:
102 have abolished it for all crimes;
7 have abolished it, but retain it for exceptional or special circumstances (such as crimes committed in wartime);
50 retain it, but have not used it for at least 10 years or are under a moratorium;
37 retain it in both law and practice.
Recent complete abolition of capital punishment
Gabon (2010), Latvia (2012), Benin (2012), Mongolia (2012), Madagascar (2012), Chad (2014, restored for terrorism in 2015), Fiji (2015), and Suriname (2015)
Execution of minors
Since 2009, Iran and Saudi Arabia have executed offenders who were under the age of 18 at the time the crime was committed.
Public execution
In 2013, public executions were carried out by the governments of Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, and Somalia.
Extrajudicial execution
In some countries the practice of extrajudicial execution sporadically or systematically outside their own formal legal frameworks occurs. Information on this is not covered in this article.


=== Industrialized world ===
Of the countries generally considered to be in the Western society (relatively wealthy, stable functional democracies with well-educated populations), just five countries continue to perform capital punishment: the United States, Japan, Singapore, St. Kitts & Nevis, and Taiwan. In South Korea, there is a moratorium.
In Europe, only Belarus continues to execute people.


=== Asia and former Soviet republics ===
Most executions worldwide take place in Asia.China is the world's most active executioner. North Korea often uses the death penalty.
In Islamic countries such as Iran and Saudi Arabia, the numbers of executions are also very high.
Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan belong to the few industrialized democracies that still have the death penalty (South Korea has a moratorium).
Of the former Soviet republics, only Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan have the death penalty. In Kazakhstan, it is only used in exceptional/special circumstances such as for crimes committed in wartime.


=== Africa ===
In Africa, it is also chiefly Islamic countries that use the death penalty. Chad repealed the death penalty in 2014, but restored it for terrorism in 2015. Botswana and Equatorial Guinea are examples of non-Islamic countries that still execute people.


=== Central and South America ===
In Central and South America, the death penalty still exists in Belize, Guatemala, Guyana, and in the Caribbean countries (it does not exist in the Dominican Republic and in Haiti; the other Caribbean countries except St. Kitts & Nevis are currently regarded as de facto abolitionists). In Brazil, Chile, El Salvador, and Peru, it is used only in exceptional/special circumstances such as for crimes committed in wartime.


=== Summary of current use ===
Worldwide, 94 countries still have capital punishment in their lawbooks, and 37 of them currently perform executions:
Of the 54 African countries, 36 have the death penalty, and 11 of them currently execute people (Botswana, Chad [only for terrorism], Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, The Gambia, Libya, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan).
Of the 35 American countries, 19 have the death penalty, but only 2 of them (the United States and St. Kitts & Nevis) currently execute people, while the others are regarded as abolitionists or as de-facto abolitionists.
Of the 57 Asian-Pacfic countries, 37 currently have the death penalty, and 23 of them still execute people (Afghanistan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, China [not in Hong Kong and Macao], India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, Malaysia, North Korea, Oman, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Syria, Taiwan, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, Vietnam, Yemen). Most executions worldwide take place in Asia.
Of the 49 European countries, only 1 (Belarus) still has the death penalty and executes people.

=== Africa ===

25 permit its use for ordinary crimes, but have not used it for at least 10 years and are believed to have a policy or established practice of not carrying out executions, or it is under a moratorium.
11 maintain the death penalty in both law and practice.
The information above is accurate as of 2015 when Uganda and Zimbabwe became de facto abolitionist for not carrying out the death penalty for over 10 years. Chad abolished the death penalty in 2014, but restored it for terrorism in 2015.
In 2014, Sudan was Africa's leading executioner. This century the following African countries have abolished capital punishment; Ivory Coast (2000), Senegal (2004), Rwanda (2007), Burundi (2009), Togo (2009), Gabon (2010), Benin (2012) and Madagascar (2012).
Executions in Africa in 2014: Egypt (16+), Equatorial Guinea (9), Somalia (14+), Sudan (23+)Note: The tables can be sorted alphabetically or chronologically using the  icon.


=== Americas ===
Of the 35 independent states in the Americas that are UN members:
16 (46%) have abolished capital punishment.
4 (11%) retain it for crimes committed in exceptional circumstances (such as in time of war).

(North Korea is thought to execute a large but unknown number of persons each year). The countries in the Americas that most recently abolished the death penalty are Suriname (2015), Argentina (2009) and Bolivia (2007).
Executions in the Americas in 2014: United States (35).

== Abolition chronology ==
The table below lists in chronological order the 103 independent states, that are either UN members or have UN observer status, that have completely abolished the death penalty. In the hundred years following the abolition of capital punishment by Venezuela in 1863 only 10 more countries were able to maintain abolition â€“ although more tried but failed to prevent re-instatement after an initial abolition. From the 1960s there has been a growing momentum towards abolition worldwide. In the 1960s 4 countries abolished (a record up to that time for any decade), in the 1970s a limited momentum was achieved when 10 countries abolished, the 1980s saw a further 9 countries abolish, but it was the fall of Communism in 1989 which turned the trickle into a torrent â€“ no fewer than 34 countries abolished in the 1990s, the individual years 1990 and 1998 are especially notable because 8 and 7 countries respectively abolished in those single years. This momentum is continuing as a further 26 countries abolished in the first decade of this century. Since 1985, there have been only four years when no country has abolished the death penalty: 1988, 2003, 2011 and 2013.
Note: Where a country has abolished, re-instated, and abolished again (e.g. Philippines, Switzerland, Portugal) only the later abolition date is included. Countries who have abolished and since reinstated (e.g. Liberia) are not included. Non-independent territories are considered to be under the jurisdiction of their parent country â€“ which leads to unexpectedly late abolition dates for the UK, New Zealand and the Netherlands, where Jersey (UK), the Cook Is (NZ), and the Netherlands Antilles, were the last territories of those states to abolish capital punishment, and all were rather later than the more well known abolitions on the respective mainlands. Defunct countries such as the GDR (East Germany), which abolished capital punishment in 1987 but was dissolved in 1990, are also not included. References are in the continental tables above and not repeated here.
