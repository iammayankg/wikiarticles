The Niewe Republiek or legally Nieuwe Republiek Zuid Afrika (New Republic in Dutch) was a Boer Republic which enjoyed international recognition by Germany and the Zuid Afrikaanse Republic, proclaimed on August 16 of 1884 with land donated by the Zulus through a treaty. It had 13,600 km and the capital was Vryheid or Vrijheid (Freedom in Afrikaans or Dutch), alternative name of the state. The founder and president until it requested incorporation by Transvaal on 20 July 1888 was Lucas Johannes Meijer ( 1846 - 1902 ), as Secretary of State acted in the same period Daniel Johannes Esselen ( 1851 - 1919 ).


== HistoryEdit ==

After Boer farmers , who lived in the area, helped Dinuzulu defeat his rival Usibepu for succession of the Zulu throne, land was given to them by way of session by the new Zulu king along the banks of the Mfolozi River. On August 5, 1884 the Boers formed the Nieuwe Republiek (New Republic) with recognition by Germany, ZAR and Portugal with Vryheid as its capital. The Nieuwe Republiek was finally recognized by the British on October 22 of 1886 but within a few months the British annexed a stretch of the coastline of the Niewe Republic and the Zulu kingdom north of the river Thukela river (1887) in order to prevent the new Boer republic access to the sea, which they needed for a harbor.

British annexation of the Zulu territory resulted in a revolt, led by Dinizulu (June 1888) who was defeated by the British and king Dinizulu was tried for high treason in Eshowe, and sentenced. The annexation of Zululand did not leave much hope for security in the Nieuwe Republiek against British imperialism. On July 20th of 1888 the New Republic was incorporated with the Transvaal on its own request, although enjoying considerable autonomy. The relations between the Boers and the Zulu continued stable until the break-out of the Second Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902).
In June 1900 the British forces entered Vryheid, the capital. AJ Shepstone, son of Sir Theophilus Shepstone, the former secretary of native affairs in Natal, was sent to the area and worked together with the official British military intelligence J. Roberts to conspire with some Zulus against the Boers, and had victory achieved over the Boers in Schurweberg, near Vryheid. In March 1901 he declared martial law in the region. After the Second Boer War the territory was transferred to the British Colony of Natal ( 1903 ).
