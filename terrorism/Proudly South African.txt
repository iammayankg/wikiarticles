The Proudly South African campaign is a South African 'buy local' marketing campaign and logo.

Cost of membership is normally 0,1% of sales of those products bearing the PSA logo, but is negotiable in special circumstances. Non-commercial organisations pay a nominal fee. The group has recently come under criticism due to the fact the majority business in the brand are White owned. Leading some to say it is less Proudly South African and more Proudly South Afrikaans.
