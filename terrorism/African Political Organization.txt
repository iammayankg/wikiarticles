The African Political Organization, later known as the African People's Organization, (APO) was a coloured political organisation in early-20th-century South Africa. Founded in Cape Town in 1902, the organisation rallied South African coloureds against the South Africa Act 1909.
Trafalgar High School was created as a direct result of criticism of the Cape School Board in the APO newspaper in August 1911. Investigations found that the board had created no benefit at all for students who were non-white. Abdullah Abdurahman lobbied the board and the first school for coloured children was created. The school was led by Abdullah Abdurahman's prodigy, Harold Cressy.
The APO represented South African coloured protest politics until its demise in 1923 while also publishing a major newspaper called The APO.
