Energy in Slovakia describes energy and electricity production, consumption and import in Slovak Republic. Energy policy of Slovakia will describe the energy policy in the politics of Slovakia more in detail. Electricity sector in Slovakia is the main article of electricity in Slovakia.
Primary energy use in Slovakia was 194 TWh and 36 TWh per million persons in 2009.


== Overview ==
¨
Slovakia is net energy importer. The share of import was 63% of the primary energy use in 2009. (IEA Key stats 2010 pages 52)


== Fossil fuels ==


=== Oil ===
Slovnaft is the largest oil refinery in Slovakia.


=== Natural gas ===
Slovenský plynárenský priemysel (Slovak Gas Industry) is the main natural gas supplier in Slovakia.


== Nuclear Energy ==
Four operating reactors in two power plants (Bohunice Nuclear Power Plant and Mochovce Nuclear Power Plant) produced 14,42 TW·h in 2014. Three other reactors at Bohunice are in permanent shutdown. Two other reactors are under construction at Mochovce.


== Renewable energy ==


=== Wind power ===
In the end of 2010 wind power capacity in Slovakia 3 MW was the lowest of the EU countries, except Malta and Slovenia. EWEA’s targets are to produce 14-17% of the EU’s electricity with wind power in 2020, and save €28 billion a year in fuel costs in Europe.


== Climate change ==
Emissions of carbon dioxide in total, per capita in 2007 were 6.8 tons CO2 compared to EU 27 average 7.9 tons CO2. Emission change 2007/1990 (%) was -35.1%. In Europe in 2007 the Slovakian emissions of carbon dioxide per capita (6.8 tons CO2) were higher than in Hungary 5.4, Sweden 5.1, Portugal 5.2 or Switzerland 5.6 and lower than in Czech Republic 11.8, Luxembourg 22.4, Finland 12.2, Netherlands 11.1, Germany 9.7 or Ireland 10.1
1990 emissions were 74 Mt CO2 eq. The Kyoto protocol target is reduction of 6 Mt (-8%).
