The Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society (CMOS) (French: La Société canadienne de météorologie et d'océanographie (SCMO)) is the national society of individuals and organisations dedicated to advancing atmospheric and oceanic sciences and related environmental disciplines in Canada.
CMOS was officially created in 1967 as the Canadian Meteorological Society and adopted its present name in 1977, following an invitation by the Canadian Meteorological Society to the oceanographic community in Canada to join the Society. However, CMOS has a rich history dating back to 1939 when it was known as the Canadian Branch of the Royal Meteorological Society.
In 2007, CMOS issued a position statement on global warming:
CMOS endorses the process of periodic climate science assessment carried out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and supports the conclusion, in its Third Assessment Report, which states that the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human influence on global climate.
