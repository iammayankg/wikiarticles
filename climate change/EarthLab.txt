EarthLab works to inform its members and the general public about the effects of global warming and climate change, partering with E-surance and the Alliance for Climate Protection. EarthLab also provides ways to prevent global warming and human created climate change. EarthLab also partnered with Office Max and Vespa to create The Earth Day Challenge, with the goal of having 1 million people take a personal carbon test, find their ECP scores then reduce their ECP scores by 15% in 2008. EarthLab.com has had over 1.5 million people worldwide take the ECP test.
The Earth Conservation Profile (ECP), a carbon & lifestyle calculator, was introduced at Live Earth, “Concerts for a Climate in Crisis”.
The ECP allows consumers to save and track their carbon score as well as their ECP results over time. A personal and private ECP profile seeks to educate and activate consumers to develop a sustainable lifestyle.
