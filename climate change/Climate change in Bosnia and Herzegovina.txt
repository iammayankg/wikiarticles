The Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Serbo-Croatian: Socijalistička Republika Bosna i Hercegovina (SR BiH) / Социјалистичка Pепублика Босна и Херцеговина (СP БиХ)) was one of the six constituent federal units forming the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It was included in Yugoslavia as a condominium of Territorial Dependency type. It was subsequently given the status of a Socialist Republic, however under strict terms of hegemonist consociationalism called "ethnic key" (Bosnian: nacionalni ključ) where balance in political representation of ethnic groups namely Serbs and Croats against Bosnian Muslims was enforced.
It is a predecessor of the modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina, and was formed as an entity during a meeting of the State Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ZAVNOBiH) in Mrkonjić Grad on 25 November 1943. In April 1945 its name was formalized as the Federal State of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a constituent unit of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia.
With DF Yugoslavia changing its name to the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia on 29 November 1945 as well as the promulgation of the 1946 Yugoslav Constitution two months later in January, its constituent units also changed their respective names. FS Bosnia and Herzegovina thus became known as the People's Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
This constitutional frame lasted until the 1963 Yugoslav Constitution. Effective 7 April 1963, the country got reconstituted as the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and PR Bosnia and Herzegovina changed its name to the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The Socialist Republic was dissolved in 1990 when it abandoned communist institutions and adopted market ones, as the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina which declared independence from Yugoslavia in 1992. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina was up to 20 December 1990 in the hands of the League of Communists of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The capital city was Sarajevo, which remained the capital following independence.
The borders of SR Bosnia and Herzegovina were almost identical to the ones Bosnia had during the period of the Austro-Hungarian rule that lasted until 1918. That year Bosnia became part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and during that period the territory was divided among banovinas. When SR Bosnia and Herzegovina was formed, it included what were the territories of most of Vrbas Banovina, the Western part of Drina Banovina, the North-Western part of Zeta Banovina, and the North-East part of Littoral Banovina.


== Towards separationEdit ==
The Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was renamed the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on April 8, 1992, losing the adjective "Socialist". It established a multi-party system and began moving towards a fully capitalist economic system. The republic retained socialist realist symbols pending the end of the Yugoslav Wars. The republic was led by Alija Izetbegović in a fractious political environment. In 1992, the Republic declared independence from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
