Bio-geoengineering is a form of climate engineering which seeks to use or modify plants or other living things to modify the Earth's climate.
Bio-energy with carbon storage, afforestation projects, and ocean nourishment (including iron fertilization) could be considered examples of bio-geoengineering.
Biogenic aerosols can be grown to replace those beneficial aerosols lost as the result of the death of 50% of Earth's boreal forests. Agricultural production of atmospheric aerosols called "monoterpenes" is possible if crops that are rich in monoterpenes are grown.
To quote Dr. Sallie Chisholm "Proponents of research on geoengineering simply keep ignoring the fact that the biosphere is a player in what ever we do, and its trajectory cannont be predicted. It is a living breathing collection of organisms that are evolving every second---a 'self-organizing, complex, adaptive system'. These types of systems have emergent properties that simply cannot be predicted. We all know this! 'Yet proponents of geoengineering research leave that out of the discussion."'. Bio-geoengineering does not neglect this obvious reality.
An emerging bio-geoengineering thesis, the Intergovernmental Marine Bio-Energy with Carbon Sequestration (IMBECS) Protocol, is an attempt to create vast scale marine biomass cultivation operations within the oceanic gyres, which, in turn, will capture, convert and store vast amount carbon. Additionally, the IMBECS Protocol offers a globally equitable means for governance of such a vast operation.
