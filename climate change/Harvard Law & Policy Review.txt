The Harvard Law and Policy Review is a law journal and the official journal of the American Constitution Society, a progressive legal organization. It was established in 2007. The journal publishes two printed editions per year, as well as additional content posted exclusively online. It is edited by Harvard Law School students.
The journal publishes articles presenting progressive ideas for law and policy written by legal scholars, policymakers, practitioners, and students. Notable authors include California Attorney General Kamala Harris, Senator Charles Schumer, late Senator Ted Kennedy, former Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius, former Attorney General Janet Reno, Associate Justice of the California Supreme Court Goodwin Liu, Chief Judge of the New York State Court of Appeals Jonathan Lippman, election law scholar Richard Hasen, Harvard Law School professors Cass Sunstein and Lani Guinier, and education advocates Randi Weingarten and Michelle Rhee.
The Harvard Law and Policy Review should not be confused with the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy, a forum for conservative and libertarian legal scholarship.
