Energy in Portugal describes energy and electricity production, consumption and import in Portugal. Energy policy of Portugal will describe the politics of Portugal related to energy more in detail. Electricity sector in Portugal is the main article of electricity in Portugal.


== Overview ==


== Coal ==
Sines power plant (hard coal) started operation in 1985-1989 in Portugal. According to WWF its CO2 emissions were among the top dirty ones in Portugal in 2007.


== Natural gas ==
Maghreb–Europe Gas Pipeline(MEG) is a natural gas pipeline, from Algeria through Morocco to Andalusia, Spain,


== Renewable energy ==

EU directive has a binding 31% target of renewables up from 20.5% in 2005. According to the Portuguese National Renewable Energy Action Plan by 2020 electricity will be produced: wind power 23% 14.6 TWh, of which 99% onshore, hydro power 22% 14.1 TWh, biomass 5% 3.52 TWh and photovoltaic solar power 2% 1.5 TWh and concentrated solar power 2% 1 TWh.


=== Solar ===
Portugal has surported and increased the solar electricity (Photovoltaic power) and solar thermal energy (solar heating) during 2006-2010. Portugal was 9th in solar heating in the EU and 8th in solar power based on total volume in 2010.


== Nuclear power ==

There were no nuclear power plants in Portugal as of 2014.


== Electricity in Portugal ==

Electricity use (gross production + imports – exports – losses) was 51.2 TWh in 2008. Portugal imported 9 TWh electricity in 2008. Population was 10.6 million.


=== Wind power ===

Portugal produced 11% of electricity with wind power in 2008 and had the average year capacity of 14% of wind power in the end 2010. Wind power capacity was 3,357 MW in end 2009 and 3,702 MW in end 2010.


=== Solar power ===

Solar electricity production with the photovoltaic arrays is pollution-free. It is easily integrated into the urban environment, close to consumption needs. It does not emit greenhouse gases, it does not dip into finite fossil fuel resources. In Lisbon the energy payback time in the roof top solar photovoltaic (PV) technology is less than 2 years and less than in Sydney, Munich, Athens or Barcelona, but some more than in Madrid, Los Angeles or Ankara.


== Transport ==
The sustainable strategy has been a shift from individual to collective transport within the Lisbon Metropolitan Area (Metro Lisbon (ML), collective buses, Companhia Carris de ferro de Lisboa).


== Global warming ==

According to Energy Information Administration the CO2 emissions from energy consumption of Portugal were in 2009 56.5 Mt, slightly over Bangladesh with 160 million people and Finland with 5.3 million people. The emissions per capita were (tonnes): Portugal 5.58, India 1.38, China 5.83, Europe 7.14, Russia 11.23, North America 14.19, Singapore 34.59 and United Arab Emirates 40.31.
