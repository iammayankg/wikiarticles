Energy in Luxembourg describes energy and electricity production, consumption and import in Luxembourg. Energy policy of Luxembourg will describe the politics of Luxembourg related to energy more in detail. Electricity sector in Luxembourg is the main article of electricity in Luxembourg.
Luxembourg is net energy importer. Primary energy use in Luxembourg was 48 TWh in 2009, or 98 TWh per million inhabitants.


== Overview ==
There was no decline in the climate change gas emissions (CO2) from year 2008 to 2012 in Luxembourg. There was no better efficiency in the use of electricity from 2008 to 2012.


== Electricity ==

In 2008, electricity use per person in Luxembourg was 2.6 times greater than in the United Kingdom.


== Renewable energy ==

Luxembourg is the EU country with the second smallest forecast penetration of renewables, with the NREAP assuming that only 12% of electricity consumption will be covered by renewables in 2020.
At the end of 2010 the installed capacity of wind power covered on average 1.1% of electricity use. Which is among the lowest in Europe, only Latvia, Czech Republic, Finland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Malta generate a smaller share of their electricity from wind power. In comparison, Ireland can generate over half of its electricity from wind power under optimal wind conditions in 2010.


== Climate change ==

Emissions of carbon dioxide in total, per capita in 2007 were 22.4 tons CO2 compared to EU 27 average 7.9 tons CO2.
1990 emissions were 13 Mt CO2eqKyoto protocol target is reduction of 4 Mt (28%).
