The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) is a British government department created on 3 October 2008 by then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown to take over some of the functions related to energy of the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and those relating to climate change of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. It is led by the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, a position held by Amber Rudd MP since 11 May 2015.
The Department released a major White Paper in July 2009 setting out its purpose and plans. The majority of DECC's spending is on managing the UK's historic nuclear sites, in 2012/13 this being 69% of its budget spent through the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority, and this is expected to increase when the last of the UK's Magnox reactors are shut down and no longer produce an income.


== Ministers ==
The DECC Ministers are as follows:


== Management ==
Permanent Secretary (7 January 2013 -) Stephen Lovegrove.

== Department of Energy and Climate Change (Abolition) Bill 2014–15 ==
This private member's bill was proposed in Parliament, sponsored by Conservative MP Peter Bone, to abolish the Department of Energy and Climate Change and absorb its portfolio into the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. In the House of Commons, it was scheduled for a second reading on 6 March 2015. However, as a private members bill, it was unlikely to be passed without government support, which in the event it failed to get. Bone had attempted to propose the bill earlier in 2014, but had withdrawn it.


== Department of Energy and Climate Change (Abolition) Bill 2015–16 ==
Mr Bone reintroduced his Bill on the 29th June 2015, and it is due to have its second reading on 30th October 2015.


== Devolution ==
The devolution of energy policy varies around the UK; most aspects in Great Britain are decided at Westminster. Key reserved and excepted energy matters (i.e. not devolved) are as follows:
Scotland 
electricity
oil and gas
coal
nuclear energy
energy efficiency
Northern Ireland
Nuclear energy is excepted.
The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment is responsible for general energy policy.
Wales
Under the Welsh devolution settlement, specific policy areas are transferred to the National Assembly for Wales rather than reserved to Westminster.
