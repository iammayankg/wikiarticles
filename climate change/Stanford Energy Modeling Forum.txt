The Energy Modeling Forum (EMF) is a structured forum for discussing important issues in energy and the environment. The EMF was established in 1976 at Stanford University. The EMF works through a series of ad hoc working groups, each focussing on a particular corporate or policy decision. The EMF provides a non-partisan platform that ensures objective consideration of opposing views.
In recent years, the EMF has made considerable contributions to the economics of climate change, as witnessed in the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and to integrated assessment modeling.
John Weyant is the current director of the EMF.
