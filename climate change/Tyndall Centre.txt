The Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research is an organisation based in the United Kingdom that brings together scientists, economists, engineers and social scientists to 'research, assess and communicate from a distinct trans-disciplinary perspective, the options to mitigate, and the necessities to adapt to current climate change and continuing global Warming, and to integrate these into the global, UK and local contexts of sustainable development'.
The centre, named after the 19th-century UK scientist John Tyndall (born in Ireland) and founded in 2000, has eight core partners: the University of East Anglia, University of Cambridge, Cardiff University, University of Manchester, Newcastle University, University of Oxford, University of Southampton, and the University of Sussex. Fudan University joined the Tyndall Centre partnership in May 2011.
From 2000 until 2010, core funding was provided by the UK's Natural Environment Research Council, the Economic and Social Research Council, and Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. The Tyndall Centre in the UK is now primarily funded by the host universities and by research grants. Fudan Tyndall Centre is funded with a 15-year commitment by the Chinese central government and the Shanghai City government.
The Tyndall Centre's director is currently Professor Corinne Le Quéré. The deputy director is Professor Kevin Anderson, and the director of strategic development is Professor Robert Watson. The deputy director for international activities is Professor Trevor Davies. The founding director is Professor Mike Hulme.
