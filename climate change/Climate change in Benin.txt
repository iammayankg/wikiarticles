Around the world, journalists who report on environmental problems such as deforestation, pollution and climate change, are forming networks and associations. The largest of these—the Society of Environmental Journalists in the United States—was formed in 1990 and has over 1400 members. Since then, journalists have formed new networks in Africa, Asia and other regions. These activities that these groups undertake include training programmes, advice to journalists, and advocacy to raise the prominence of environmental topics in the media. In Africa and Asia, these networks also act to raise funds to support better quality reporting on environmental issues. James Fahn, director of the Earth Journalism Network, notes however that donors generally seem less willing to support these journalism associations than they do environmental advocacy groups.
Networks of environment journalists are able to work in ways that would be impossible for individual reporters. The Philippine Network of Environmental Journalists has, for instance, built an SMS-based news service that connects hyperlocal reports on environmental issues and disaster events to a national audience. The project included the development of a new website and trainings held with local journalists and their audiences.
Another way that such networks have acted is to protest the dangers that environmental journalists face because their reporting challenges powerful elites. In September 2012, the Earth Journalism Network and the Society of Environmental Journalists circulated a joint petition calling on the Cambodian government to launch a full investigation into the murder of environmental journalist Hang Serei Oudom.
