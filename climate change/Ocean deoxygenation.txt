Ocean deoxygenation is a term that has been suggested to describe the expansion of oxygen minimum zones in the world's oceans as a consequence of anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide [1][2].
Oceanographers and others have discussed what phrase best describes the phenomenon to non-specialists. Among the options considered have been 'ocean suffocation' (which was used in a news report from May 2008 [3]), 'ocean oxygen deprivation' [4], 'decline in ocean oxygen', 'marine deoxygenation', 'ocean oxygen depletion' and 'ocean hypoxia'.


== Implications ==
Ocean deoxygenation poses implications for ocean productivity, nutrient cycling, carbon cycling, and marine habitat. Ocean model simulations predict a decline of up to 7% in the global ocean O2 content over the next hundred years. The decline of Oxygen is projected to continue for a thousand years or more.
