The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution in the United Kingdom was created under Royal Warrant in 1970 to advise the Queen, Government, Parliament and the public on environmental issues. It was closed on 1 April 2011, as part of the Coalition Government's spending cuts.


== Overview ==
The Commission's reports covered both the natural environment and the built environment, including topics such as nuclear power, energy use and climate change, the environmental impact of housing, and the use of pesticides and chemicals.
The Commission was a non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, to whom it reported.
