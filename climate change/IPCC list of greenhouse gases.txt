This is a list of LLGHG (long-lived greenhouse gases) greenhouse gases as used by the IPCC TAR.


== Gases relevant to radiative forcing only (per IPCC documentation) ==
The following table has its sources in Chapter 2, p. 141, Table 2.1. of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, 2007.
Mole fractions: Î¼mol/mol = ppm = parts per million (106); nmol/mol = ppb = parts per billion (109); pmol/mol = ppt = parts per trillion (1012).
The older data from 1998 has been left for reference.
