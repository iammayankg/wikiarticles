== Palmolein Import ScamEdit ==
The allegation of Palmolein Import Scam occurred during the year 1991–92 in the Kerala state when K. Karunakaran was the chief minister of the state and the ruling party was United Democratic Front. During this time Oommen Chandy was the Finance Minister of the state and was responsible for financial accounts of the state of Kerala. This scam allegedly caused a loss of ₹2.32 crore to the state. The case once closed after the death of K. Karunakaran in December 2010 was reopened in March 2011 during the election period of 2011. However this did not affect the election results to a great extent.
The court stated that Chandy had approved of the import of palmolein through "Power and Energy Ltd" by paying 15% service charge and it was evident from his signature in the note. However the court has not been able to show any direct involvement of Oommen Chandy in the scam . Aiding to the investigation of the case in 2011, when the case was reopen, Oommen Chandy, the then Chief Minister had agreed to step down from the Office of Chief Minister of Kerala in 2011, and face the case "legally and morally". But on the advice on Congress core committee, Oommen Chandy continues to stay incumbent. To provide more trust and transparency to the investigation, Oommen Chandy gave up the portfolio of Vigilance and Anti Corruption.
The vigilance court asked the vigilance and anti-corruption bureau to submit its investigation report of the palmolein case by November 10, 2011. The Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) gave a clean chit to Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy on January 7, 2012. The Vigilance team submitted its further probe report in the palmolein import case, saying there was no evidence to arraign Chief Minister Oommen Chandy as an accused.
The facts, evidences and circumstances of the case in the probe showed Oommen Chandy had not committed any illegal acts or omissions as the then finance minister, the report said.
The VACB report said Oommen Chandy was not part of the conspiracy which caused the state exchequer a loss of ₹2.32 crore. He had not acted in a manner to ensure undue monetary advantage for the private firm involved in the import.
Solar Case is a pending case against Oomen Chandy.
