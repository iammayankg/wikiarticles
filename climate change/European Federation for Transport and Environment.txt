The European Federation for Transport and Environment, commonly referred to as Transport & Environment (T&E) is a European umbrella for non-governmental organisations working in the field of transport and the environment, promoting sustainable transport in Europe; which means an approach to transport that is environmentally responsible, economically sound and socially just.


== History ==
T&E was created in 1990 with the realisation that many political decisions that influence the environmental damage caused by transport - both positively and negatively - are taken at a European level. These involve getting transport prices right, vehicle emission limits, fuel quality standards, taxes, funding of infrastructure, safety requirements, air quality standards, deregulation and liberalization and more.
