The Individual Deprivation Measure (IDM) is a way of measuring poverty that was developed over four years by the IWDA. It measures poverty on an individual level as opposed to a household level. The IDM was designed to avoid gender biases built into existing poverty measures. The household method assumes that everyone is equally poor but an organization called ONE claims that it is not and that 70% of the poor are female. The goal of the Individual Deprivation Measure is to create a public standard of deprivation that is comparable across contexts, revealing gender disparity, and guiding antipoverty policy and programs.
Two of the authors of The Individual Deprivation Measure: A Gender-Sensitive Approach to Poverty Measurement, Pogge and Jaggar realized that statistics used to demonstrate the feminization of poverty reflected cultural and gender biases. They set out to create a non-arbitrary metric for poverty that could be used to measure the feminist aspect of poverty.
Australia has used the Individual Deprivation Measure. They discussed the measure and the results at the UN on March 18, 2015. Scott Wisor stated that monetary poverty measurement is not adequate to count poverty and should be complimented with multidimensional measurements.
