A tor enclosure is a prehistoric monument found in the southwestern part of the Great Britain. These monuments emerged around 4000 BC in the early Neolithic.


== Description ==
Tor enclosures are large enclosures situated near natural rock outcrops, especially tors, on hilltops or the sides of hills. They consist of one or more roughly circular stone walls built around the tor. They are comparable to the causewayed enclosures found elsewhere in the British Isles and many are of similar Neolithic date although others are from later in prehistory.


== Examples ==
The best known examples are Carn Brea in Cornwall, the first to be identified, following excavations in the early 1970s, and Helman Tor between Bodmin and Lostwithiel in the same county.
Other possible candidates are:
Rough Tor on Bodmin Moor, Cornwall
Stowe's Hill, also on Bodmin Moor
Whittor on Dartmoor.
