Poverty in North Korea is believed to be extensive, though reliable statistics are hard to come by due to lack of reliable research, pervasive censorship and extensive media manipulation in North Korea. As with similar regimes that rarely disclose reliable statistics, much of what can be quantified is understood through measures of health, nutrition and education.
Poverty of North Korea is widely recognized and reported on, and often discussed in the context of numerous famines that affect that country, in particular the North Korean famine of the late 1990s.
Poverty in Korea has been attributed to poor governance by the totalitarian regime.
