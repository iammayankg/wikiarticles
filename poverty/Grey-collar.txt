Grey-collar refers to the balance of employed people not classified as white- or blue collar. It is used to refer to occupations that incorporate some of the elements of both blue- and white-collar, and generally are in between the two categories in terms of income-earning capability.
Examples of grey-collar industries:
Fire fighters, police officers, nurses, and medical technicians
Farming, fishing, forestry, and other forms of agribusiness
Health care, elderly care, child care, and the personal service sector
Protective services and security
Food preparation and the catering industry
High tech technicians
Skilled trades, technicians, etc.
Typists, stenographers, and paralegals
Grey-collar workers often have associate degrees from a community college in a particular field. They are unlike blue-collar workers in that blue-collar workers can often be trained on the job within several weeks whereas grey-collar workers already have a specific skill set.
The field which most recognizes the diversity between these two groups is that of human resources and the insurance industry. These different groups must be insured differently for liability as the potential for injury is different.
