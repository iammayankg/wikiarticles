¿Quién mató a la llamita blanca? (English: Who killed the little white llama?) is a 2007 Bolivian movie that was written by Juan Cristobal Rios Violand and directed by Rodrigo Bellott. The film is both a celebration and a parody of Bolivian customs, countryside and culture, with a serious message about the endemic poverty in Bolivia.

Jacinto and Domitila are two indigenous Bolivians who are both happily married and the most notorious criminals in the country. They accept a job to transport 50 kg of cocaine to the Brazilian border. They disguise themselves as a farming couple expecting a baby, with the cocaine hidden in Domitilas false pregnant belly.
The man behind the smuggling operation is El Negro, an American who has secrets of his own. On the trail of Jacinto and Domitilia are two anti-narcotics officers, who turn out to have immoral and illegal sides of their own.
