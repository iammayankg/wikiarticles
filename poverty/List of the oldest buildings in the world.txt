This article lists the oldest free-standing buildings constructed in the world, including on each of the continents and within each country. "Building" is defined as any human-made structure used or intended for supporting or sheltering any use or continuous occupancy. In order to qualify for list a structure must:
be a recognisable building;
incorporate features of building work from the claimed date to at least 1.5 metres (4.9 ft) in height;
be largely complete or include building work to this height for most of its perimeter.
This consciously excludes ruins of limited height and statues. The list also excludes:
dolmens—a type of single-chamber megalithic tomb, usually consisting of three or more upright stones supporting a large flat horizontal capstone—unless they were originally covered over to form a barrow and used for collective burials. (Neolithic dolmens are extremely numerous, with over 1,000 reported from Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in Germany alone.)
cairns which are simply large piles of loose stones (as opposed to chambered cairns.)
Dates for many of the oldest structures have been arrived at by radiocarbon dating and should be considered approximate.


== By age ==
The following are amongst the oldest buildings in the world. Many of them are brick structures. There are numerous extant structures that survive in the Orkney islands of Scotland, some of the best known of which are part of the Heart of Neolithic Orkney World Heritage Site. The list also contains many large buildings from the Egyptian Age of the Pyramids.


== By continent ==
The following are amongst the oldest extant buildings on each of the major continents.


== By country ==
The following are among the oldest buildings in their respective countries.


== Miscellaneous ==


=== Oldest of their type ===
The following are probably the oldest buildings of their type.


=== Other structures ===
The following are very old human constructions that do not fit the above criteria for a building, typically because they are ruins that no longer fit the height requirement specified above or for which the only significant above-ground elements are single large stones.
