Association marocaine des droits humains (AMDH) (Arabic: الجمعية المغربية لحقوق الإنسان‎), known in English as the Moroccan Association of Human Rights (MAHR), is a Moroccan non-profit human rights non-governmental organization.


== History and profile ==
The AMDH was founded on 24 June 1979 in Rabat by the Socialist Union of Popular Forces (USFP).
AMDH is a member of the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues (FIDH). The current president is Khadija Ryadi.
AMDH publishes an annual report on human rights in Morocco. The 2010 report, cataloguing multiple human rights abuses including torture, suggests that the country has made little progress in human rights over the past year.
In 2006, AMDH was instrumental in the creation of national coordinating structures known as "les coordinations" to fight against poverty in Morocco. In 2011, ADMH sought to relaunch this structure, drawing on the momentum of the Arab Spring.
