Belizean Americans are Americans who are of Belizean ancestry. These ancestors might be from the Central American country of Belize or of its diaspora.


== Diaspora ==
About one out of every three Belizeans now live overseas and outside of Belize; the majority have migrated to Anglophone countries, especially the United States, where there are some 54,925 Belizeans, and the United Kingdom, with around 3,000 Belizeans. Smaller numbers now live in Canada.
Kriols and other ethnic groups are emigrating mostly to the United States, but also to the United Kingdom and other developed nations for better opportunities. Based on the latest U.S. Census, Belizeans in the United States are primarily of the Kriol and Garinagu ethnic groups. In 1990, there were about 10,000 Belizean Americans citizens in the United States.
