== History ==
Many of the current families living in Waialua are the results of agricultural industry which began in the early 1900s. There was an increased demand for workers as the industry grew, resulting in workers being brought in from China, Portugal, Japan, Korea, Puerto Rico, the Philippines and other areas. Upon arriving in Hawaii, many of these workers were assigned to work in the sugar plantations in Waialua. During the late 1980s and into the 1990s, the sugar production decreased as increasing labor and production costs caused producers to move overseas. Many of the families brought to Waialua during the sugar rush remained here and many of their descendants reside there today.
