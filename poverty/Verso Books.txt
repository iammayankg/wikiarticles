Verso Books (formerly New Left Books) is a publishing house based in London and New York City, founded in 1970 by the staff of New Left Review.


== Renaming, new brand and logo ==
Verso Books was originally known as New Left Books. The name was changed in 2008. The name "Verso" refers to the technical term for the left-hand page in a book (see Recto and verso), and is a play on words regarding its political outlook and also reminds of the vice versa - "the other way around".
The new logo of the company shows a big red "V" with bolded left arm that also could be readed like a double V (one big and one smaller), and on the twitter of the Publisher the huge V-logo is even tripled in the background.


== History and details ==
The publisher gained early recognition for translations of books by European thinkers, especially those from the Frankfurt School.
Verso Books' best-selling title is the autobiography of Rigoberta Mench√∫, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1992.
Verso Books titles are distributed in the United States by Random House.
