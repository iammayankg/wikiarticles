Plano point is a general term used by archaeologists to describe a variety of different chipped stone projectile points (arrow and spear heads) used by the various Plano cultures of the North American Great Plains between 9000 BC and 6000 BC to hunt, and possibly kill other humans.
They are bifacially worked and have been divided into numerous sub-groups based on variations in size, shape and function including Alberta points, Cody points, Frederick points, Eden points and Scottsbluff points. Plano points do not include the hollowing or 'fluting' found in Clovis and Folsom points.
