The theology of relational care pertains to ministering to the personal needs of others, primarily individuals going through crises of a temporal nature. This may include individuals and families experiencing poverty, ill health, stigmatization, or ostracization from mainstream society. Addressing these needs in relation to theology is generally facilitated in a religious or parachurch environment. The teaching is birthed from the biblical teaching of the Great Commandment, which admonishes followers to love their neighbors, and is modeled in the earthly ministry and teachings of Jesus Christ. For example, he was intentional about spending time with and ministering to individuals who experience poverty, illness, depression, hunger, grieving, and whatever their need was in their life. In the Parable of the Good Samaritan, Jesus told a story that highlighted loving our neighbors, which includes individuals who may be overlooked or marginalized by others.
