Jacobin is a quarterly magazine based in New York. Its self-styled raison d’être is as a "leading voice of the American left, offering socialist perspectives on politics, economics, and culture". The publication began as an online magazine released in September 2010, but expanded into a print journal later that year. Jacobin has been described by its publisher as a radical publication, "largely the product of a younger generation not quite as tied to the Cold War paradigms that sustained the old leftist intellectual milieus like Dissent or New Politics."
The New York Times ran a profile of Bhaskar Sunkara, the founding editor and publisher of Jacobin in January 2013, commenting on the publication's unexpected success and engagement with mainstream liberalism.
In a 2013 article for Tablet Magazine, Michelle Goldberg discussed Jacobin as part of a revival of interest in Marxism among young intellectuals.
Earlier in 2013, "Jacobin Books" was announced, a partnership with Verso Books and Random House. A collection of essays by Jacobin contributors is also slated to be published by Henry Holt and Company in 2015. "Class Action: An Activist Teacher’s Handbook," produced in conjunction with the Chicago Teachers Union's CORE Caucus and Jacobin was distributed to trade union activists in the 16 cities in the United States and Canada. Additionally, since the fall of 2014, Jacobin has sponsored more than 60 socialist reading groups.
Prominent Jacobin contributors include Bob Herbert, Yanis Varoufakis, Hilary Wainwright, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
