Energy for All is the name of an initiative and partnership, both founded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), to reduce energy poverty in Asia and the Pacific.
The initiative aims to develop approaches for providing access to reliable and affordable energy services, and to scale them up. This includes household access to electricity from renewable energy technologies such as micro-hydro, solar, biomass, and small wind power, as well as access to clean cooking fuel, such as LPG or biogas from livestock manure. The partnership was created to allow entities from different sectors in the region to cooperate. Its stated goal is to provide access to energy to 100 million people in the region by 2015.
