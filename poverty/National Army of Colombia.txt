The National Army of Colombia (Spanish: Ejército Nacional de Colombia) is the land military force of Colombia and the largest branch of the Colombian Armed Forces. It is responsible for carrying out land-based military operations along with the Colombian Naval Infantry (Infanteria de Marina) and for protecting the Colombian state against domestic or foreign threats.
The modern Colombian Army has its roots in the Army of the Commoners (Ejército de los Comuneros), which was formed on the 7th of August of 1819, before the establishment of the present day Colombia to meet the demands of the Revolutionary War against the Spanish Empire. After their triumph against the Spanish, the Congress of Angostura created the Greater Colombian Army, to replace the disbanded Commoners Army.


== HistoryEdit ==

The Colombian Army traces its history back to the 1770s and 1780s, when the Comuneros (Commoners) – mostly descendants of Spanish and Amerindians – decided to separate from the Spanish Empire to create their own country and initiated a revolutionary war.
By 1810, as the nation declared independence, a Volunteer National Guard was raised composed of infantry and cavalry units. Nationwide civil war prevented a full establishment of a regular army, and it would take 9 years before a truly national army would be formed.
The Greater Colombian Army was consolidated on August 7, 1819, following the defeat of the Spaniards at the Battle of Boyacá under the command of Simon Bolivar. Since then the Colombian Army has been the biggest organization in Colombia.
The military reform carried out by General Rafael Reyes Prieto in the year 1907, right in the aftermath of the Thousand Days War, marked the professionalization of the Colombian Armed Forces, resulting in the opening of the Colombian Military Academy. The Army was then dramatically changed by modernization efforts, which included among them the consultation of two military missions in the 1920s by the Chilean and Swiss armies.


=== Recent historyEdit ===

The Colombian Army is presently at war with leftist rebels of the FARC, ELN and EPL, as well as other minor groups. Throughout the war, military personnel have usually maintained a level of professionalism.
Members of the military have been accused or condemned of collaborating with the activities of right wing paramilitaries, such as the AUC and others. The BBC and other sources have reported on cases of corruption within the military, as well as other scandals.
The United States government approved the Plan Colombia initiative. Part of the resources provided by this initiative would be directed to the support of the Colombian Army by strengthening its combat and logistics capabilities.
The Supreme Commander of the Colombian Army is the President of Colombia, with a four star General being sub-commander.
Several courses within the Colombian Army are world recognized due to their demanding nature. The most well known among these being the Lancero School. This course – dedicated in counterinsurgency warfare – is held in Tolemaida, 150 miles (240 km) from Bogotá, where temperatures range between 85 and 100 degrees F. (29.5–38 degrees C.) throughout the year. The course, which has been called the toughest in the world, is run by the Colombian army, with U.S. military instructors also playing a role. According to Paris Match (no. 2964, March 9–15, 2006) the course lasts 73 days and trains Bolivian, Ecuadorean, and Panamanian troops as well as Colombian soldiers; some French and American soldiers are also trained there. The course, founded in 1955, was based in the metholody of the Ranger School, of the US Army. Lethal techniques and live ammunition are used. Because of its exceptional nature, the course has gained international prestige.


==== Overseas military operationsEdit ====


===== Korean WarEdit =====
During the Korean War, some 4,314 troops of the Colombian Army (21% of the total force) served with the Colombia Battalion in the United Nations Command. The initial contingent of troops transported to Korea aboard the USNS Aiken Victory. Once in-country, the Colombia Battalion received training and then joined the American 21st Infantry Regiment on 1 August 1951. It was engaged in battle during Operation Nomadic, for which the battalion received a Presidential Unit Citation. In 1952, as the 21st Infantry Regiment redeployed, the Colombia Battalion was transferred to the 31st Infantry Regiment. The battalion was greatly involved in the Battle of Old Baldy. Colombian soldiers killed in action were sometimes cremated at the United Nations Cemetery in Tanggok and repatriated in 1954. Overall, the Colombian Army lost 141 soldiers by death and suffered 556 battle injuries.


===== SinaiEdit =====
The Colombian National Army deployed soldiers in the Sinai as part of the United Nations Emergency Force between 1956 and 1967. Since 1980 it has supplied one battalion ('COLBATT') to the Multinational Force and Observers there.

Army officer uniforms included a full-dress uniform of blue coat and white trousers for a cold climate; a white full-dress uniform for a hot climate; several different dress uniforms for both hot and cold climates that consisted of some combination of blue and white coat and trousers with piping or fringe on the trousers to indicate branch of service; an olive-drab barracks uniform for a cold climate; a tan gabardine barracks uniform for a hot climate; and tan gabardine service and field uniforms for all climates.

Since 2006 the National Army of Colombia changed its uniform type forest (woodland) by a modern design featuring a new digital camouflage pattern is called a pixel.
There are 2 types of camouflage, jungle camouflage that is used by most of the army and the desert camouflage that is used by troops in the department of La Guajira and the Colombia Battalion in the Sinai peninsula in the Multinational Force and Observers.
The changes provide greater comfort to the troops, while the material used allows even for the application of mosquito repellent to prevent mosquito bites and a high percentage of the concentration of bacteria and odors.
