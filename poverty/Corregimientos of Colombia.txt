Corregimiento is a term used in Colombia to define a subdivision of Colombian municipalities. According to the Colombian Constitution of 1991 and Decree 2274 of October 4, 1991, a corregimiento is an internal part of a Department or province, which includes a population core. It is usually less populated than a municipality.[1].

Historically, a corregimiento was administered by a corregidor.
