The Logic of Scientific Discovery (German: Logik der Forschung. Zur Erkenntnistheorie der modernen Naturwissenschaft) is a 1934 book about the philosophy of science by Karl Popper. The German title literally translates as, The Logic of Research. Popper rewrote his book in English and republished it in 1959. The work has become famous.


== Summary ==
Popper argues that science should adopt a methodology based on falsifiability, because no number of experiments can ever prove a theory, but a single experiment can contradict one. Popper held that empirical theories are characterized by falsifiability.


== Reception ==
The Logic of Scientific Discovery has become famous. Harry Guntrip writes that its publication "greatly stimulated the discussion of the nature of scientific knowledge, even by those who do not wholly agree with him, such as Kuhn of Princeton...and Harr√© of Oxford". Carl Jung, founder of analytical psychology, valued the work according to the writer Vincent Brome, who recalls Jung remarking in 1938 that it exposed "some of the shortcomings of science". Philosopher Bryan Magee writes that Popper's criticisms of logical positivism were "devastating". In Magee's view, Popper's most important argument against logical positivism is that, while it claimed to be a scientific theory of the world, its central tenet, the verification principle, effectively destroyed all of science.
Alan Sokal writes that a significant part of the problems that currently affect the philosophy of science "can be traced to ambiguities or inadequacies in Popper's The Logic of Scientific Discovery".
