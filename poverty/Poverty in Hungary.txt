The Frozen Child (Hungarian:A Megfagyott gyermek) is a 1921 Hungarian silent drama film directed by Béla Balogh and starring Mária Szepes, Ferenc Szécsi, Anna Breznay and Viktor Galánthay. It is one of the few surviving Hungarian films of the early 1920s. It was unusual for its depiction of poverty in Hungary at a time when this was discouraged or censored by the authorities.
