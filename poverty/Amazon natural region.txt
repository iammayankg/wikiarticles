Amazonía region in southern Colombia comprises the departments of Amazonas, Caquetá, Guainía, Guaviare, Putumayo and Vaupés, and covers an area of 403,000 km², 35% of Colombia's total territory. The region is mostly covered by tropical rainforest, or jungle, which is a part of the massive Amazon rainforest.


== Biogeographical subregions ==
The region is bounded by the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|East Andes]] along the western edge and extends to the Venezuelan and Brazilian borders in the east. The northern limit begins with the Guaviare and Vichada Rivers and extends south to the Putumayo and Amazon Rivers.
The Amazon region is divided up into distinct subregions:
Amazon foothills: bordering the East Andes
Caquetá River Plain: the main watershed of this region
Inírida River Plain: location of the famous Cerros de Mavecure
Guaviare River Plain: shared with the Eastern Plains
Putumayo River Plain: along the southern border
Serranía de Chiribiquete
Amazon Trapezium: the area of land that actually borders with the Amazon River
Other important rivers include the Vaupés, Apaporis and Yarí.


== Biodiversity ==
The tropical rainforest classified more specifically as a tropical moist broadleaf forest. Within the Colombian Amazon region there are five moist forest ecoregions:
Caquetá moist forest: the largest part of the Colombian Amazon region centered on the Caquetá, Vaupés, Yarí, and Apaporis Rivers
Napo moist forest: the southwest corner of the Colombian Amazon region which borders the Andes and includes the headwaters of the Caquetá and Putumayo Rivers
Solimões-Japurá moist forest: in Colombia this ecoregion is centered on the Putumayo and Amazon Rivers
Japurá-Solimões-Negro moist forest: this ecoregion barely extends into Colombia mainly around the Lower Vaupés and Negro Rivers
Río Negro Campinarana: this ecoregion of white sandy forest and swamps barely extends into Colombia around the Negro River in the Department of Vaupés
