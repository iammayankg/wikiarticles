=== Kandahar Governor ===
Karzai's government ruled that officials could not hold military and civil posts simultaneously, hence he replaced Gul Agha Sherzai as the governor of Kandahar and appointed Yousaf Pashtun on 15 August 2003. Sherzai transferred the power peacefully as Pashtun was much close to him and they were from the same Barakzai tribe. Yousef Pashtun was seen as central government loyalist and more effective manager, Afghan officials said. International Community was also interested to work with him for the rehabilitation of Kandahar as he was an experienced Engineer & Technical Expert. Yousef Pashtun tried to enhance the development projects in Kandahar which will create more job opportunities for the locals, leading to the stabilization of the region. He was successful in his goals, to achieve development and peace in the province. As he was not known as a Tribal leader, but as an Intellectual, hence he was able to unite the tribes efficiently. During his term, he reduced the poppy cultivation by 40% in the province, he also worked on uniting the Governors of Southern Afghanistan(Kandahar, Helmand, Oruzgan, Zabul and Nimroz) to cooperate with each other. He worked on Kandahar's New master plan, rehabilitation of city roads and upgrading the local Municipality System in the city.

As a Minister of Urban Development, he established an Independent Board for the Development of Kabul New City. The Board brings together key stakeholders, including relevant government agencies, as well as urban specialists and economists. The board prepared a master plan for the city in the context of Greater Kabul. The master plan and its implementation strategy for 2025 were endorsed by the Afghan Cabinet in early 2009.

=== Public Image ===
Pashtun is much known for his strict fight against land mafia when he was Minister of Urban Development as well as Senior Adviser to the President. He is currently Head of the Committee for counter land grabbing and land mafia. He got much public acclaim when he revealed the name of Marshal Qaseem Fahim, the then Vice President of Afghanistan as the leader of land mafia and involved in several huge land grabbing cases in Afghanistan on National Television. This interview portrayed his image as a Politician who is much blunt and not involved in political deals in Afghanistan. Some political analysts highlights his transfer from Minister to Senior Adviser to President as a move to keep him more involved in this fight against land mafia. Unlike Cabinet minister who is answerable to both houses of Parliament, Vice Presidents and other Government authorities, as Adviser of President he can perform his job without any interruption from Members of Parliaments or any other political group. He is also known as one of the most influential Adviser to President Karzai, especially on technical issues.
