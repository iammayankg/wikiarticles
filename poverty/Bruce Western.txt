Bruce Prichart Western (born 1964) is an Australian-born American sociologist and the Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Professor of Criminal Justice Policy at Harvard University. He is also the director of the Malcolm Wiener Center for Social Policy at Harvard, and the faculty chair of the Program in Criminal Justice Policy and Management at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. He has been called "one of the leading academic experts on American incarceration."


== Education ==
Born in Australia, Western received his BA in government with honors from the University of Queensland in 1987. He subsequently received his masters' and PhD degrees in sociology from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1990 and 1993, respectively.


== Career ==
After receiving his PhD, Western taught at Princeton University for fourteen years until joining Harvard in 2007 as the director of the Kennedy School's Multidisciplinary Program in Inequality and Social Policy.


== Research ==


=== Prisons and mass incarceration ===
Originally, Western's research pertained to organized labor, but he became interested in researching prisons and mass incarceration, in his words, "almost by accident" after talking to a colleague about the United States' use of prisons to manage disadvantaged populations. As of 2008, he had written or co-written more than a dozen articles about prisons, as well as a book ("Punishment and Inequality in America") on the same topic. In "Punishment and Inequality in America", originally published in 2006, he concludes that "mass imprisonment has erased many of the "gains to African American citizenship hard won by the civil rights movement."" In a 2010 study, Western and fellow sociologist Becky Pettit outlined the way in which, according to them, poverty increases prison populations and these populations in turn increase poverty.


=== Unions ===
He has also researched the relationship between the decline of unions and increasing income inequality, and has found that the former accounted for a third of the increase in income inequality among male workers.


== Honors and awards ==
Western's book "Punishment and Inequality in America" won both the 2008 Michael J. Hindelang Book Award from the American Society of Criminology and the 2007 Albert J. Reiss, Jr. Distinguished Scholarship Award from the American Sociological Association. Western was inducted into the National Academy of Sciences in 2015.


== Personal life ==
As of 2008, Western lived in Brookline, Massachusetts with his wife and three daughters.
