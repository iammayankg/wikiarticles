Poverty in Colombia refers to the serious problem of misdistribution of income, characterized by some of the worst poverty statistics in Latin America.


== Social strata in Colombia ==
Colombia has one of the most stratified social systems in the world.
Colombia's social strata have been divided as follows and have been extensively used by the government as a reference to develop social welfare programs, statistical information and to some degree for the assignment of lands.
Stratum 1 : Lowest income.
Stratum 2 : Low-Middle class.
Stratum 3 : Middle class.
Stratum 4 : Upper middle class.
Stratum 5 : Upper class.
Stratum 6 : Wealthy. Only the 5% of Colombians fit this category.
The system classifies areas on a scale from 1 to 6 with 1 as the lowest income area and 6 as the highest. In 1994, this stratification policy was made into law in order to grant subsidies to the poorest residents. The system is organized so that the people living in upper layers (strata 5 and 6) pay more for services like electricity, water and sewage than the groups in the lower strata. Critics of the system say that it impedes social mobility through stigmatization, while its proponents argue that it allows the poor to locate to areas where they will be able to access subsidized services.
