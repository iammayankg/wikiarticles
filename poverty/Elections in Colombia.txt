Elections in Colombia are regulated and controlled by the National Electoral Council which also gives information on elections and election results in for the politics of Colombia.
Colombia elects on national level a head of state - the president - and a legislature. The president is elected for a four-year term by the people. The Congress' (Congreso) has two chambers. The Chamber of Representatives (Cámara de Representantes) has 162 members, elected for a four-year term by proportional representation. The Senate of the Republic (Senado de la República) has 102 members, elected for a four-year term by proportional representation.
Colombia had a two-party system, in which it could be difficult for third parties to find success. Politicians from the two main parties tend to win elections when not confronted by strong challengers from their own party (in which cases their traditional opponents tend to win). Recent electoral inroads made by a number of independent candidates towards the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st, such as the elections of Antanas Mockus and later Luis Eduardo Garzón as mayors of Bogotá, amid a climate of perceived generalized dissatisfaction with the country's political background, have tended to shows signs that past electoral trends may be weakening and the potential for diversity could be increasing.
Electoral fraud, bribery, and other scandals that occur at both municipal and national levels are part of Colombia's corruption problem.
