Prostitution in the Palestinian territories is illegal, under Palestinian Authority law. Ramallah is one of the few outlets for prostitution in the Palestinian territories as premarital sex is seen as taboo in the territories. A recent report by the UN Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) and SAWA-All the Women Together Today and Tomorrow, a Palestinian NGO, suggests that an increasing number of women are taking up prostitution in the face of poverty and violence.
