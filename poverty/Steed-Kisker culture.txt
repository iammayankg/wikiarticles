The Steed-Kisker culture is a cultural phase (name that archaeologists give to a group of culturally similar peoples) that is part of the larger Central Plains Tradition of prehistoric people who occupied the Great Plains region of the United States in prehistoric times. This group lived primarily around the Kansas City, Missouri (MO) area from about 900 to 1400 CE. The Cloverdale archaeological site near St. Joseph, Missouri is one of the more important sites associated with the phase. Other sites with Steed-Kisker occupations include the Crabtree Site (23CL164), the Katz Site (23CL163) and the Steed-Kisker Site for which the culture is named. Many Cahokia style projectile points found at the sites have shown a connection with Mississippian cultures to the east.
