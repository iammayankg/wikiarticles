Kabete is one of 12 constituencies within Kiambu County, as of 2012 but parts of it are in Nairobi County. In 2010 when reforms were made to Kenya's Constitution, the country was organized into 47 counties in order to foster a more decentralized government throughout the country. The delineations of these counties align (almost exactly) with the demarcations of the legally recognized districts, established in 1989 during President Arap Moi's presidency. Each county has a single member constituency in what is Kiambu County, led by the governor William Kabogo. Kabete Constituency Member of Parliament is Ferdinard Waititu, who was elected following the murder of George Muchai.
Geographically speaking, Kabete is located less than 15 kilometers outside of the capital city of Nairobi. According to the 2009 census, the Kabete area has a population of 140,427. As part of the Nairobi Highlands area, the region's environment remains unpolluted.
A study in 2005 revealed that Kabete constituency has the lowest poverty rate in Kenya [1].
Anthropologist Louis Leakey was born in Kabete. His nickname was Giteru and hence the reference Kabete gwa Giteru (Meaning Kabete, Giteru's place). A school by the name Mary Leakey High School, found in the Lower Kabete area remains as part of his family's legacy.
