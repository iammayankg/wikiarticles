After the Colombian first declaration of independence from Spain on 20 July 1810, a number of independent States like Tunja (1811), Antioquia (1812), Cartagena de Indias (1812) and Cundinamarca (1812) were established. Each State had its own body in charge of the administration of justice. Later, when these States established the Provincias Unidas de la Nueva Granada (United Provinces of New Granada), on 23 September 1814, the Alto Tribunal de Justicia (High Tribunal of Justice) was established. In 1819, the Republic of Colombia (the Gran Colombia) was born. A Court was created according to the provisions its Constitution of 30 August 1821, named Alta Corte de Justicia (High Court of Justice). In 1830, the Gran Colombia was dissolved and the Republic of New Granada was formed. As per the provisions of its Constitution of 29 February 1832, the Corte Suprema de Justicia (Supreme Court of Justice) was established. On 20 May 1853, it became the Corte Suprema de la Nación (Supreme Court of the Nation). In 1858, the Grenadine Confederation was founded. On adoption of its Constitution of 22 May 1858, the Courte Suprema (Supreme Court) became the body in charge of the administration of justice. In 1863, the Grenadine Confederation was replaced by the Estados Unidos de Colombia (United States of Colombia). On adoption of its Constitution of 8 May 1863, the Corte Suprema Federal (Supreme Federal Court) was established. Finally, after the establishment of the República de Colombia (Republic of Colombia) and on adoption of its Constitution of August 4, 1886, the body was renamed as the present, the Corte Suprema de Justicia (Supreme Court of Justice) on 3 September 1886.
