== Female genital mutilation ==
According to a United Nations report of 1995, 60 percent of Chadian women had been subject to female genital mutilation. The procedure is a traditional rite of passage as a girl moves into adulthood and it is followed regardless of religious orientation. It is equally common amongst Muslims, Christians and animists. Those who attain adulthood without being mutilated generally avoid it for life.
