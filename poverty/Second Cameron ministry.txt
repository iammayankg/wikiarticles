David Cameron formed the Second Cameron ministry following the 7 May 2015 general election in Britain. Prior to the election, Cameron led the first Cameron ministry, a coalition government that consisted of members of the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats.


== History ==
Cameron announced his choice for Chancellor of the Exchequer, Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary and Defence Secretary on the afternoon of 8 May 2015, with George Osborne, Theresa May, Philip Hammond and Michael Fallon retaining their posts. Osborne was also given the honorific title of First Secretary of State, which had been held by William Hague in the preceding ministry. 
Cameron's choices for other ministers were announced through the week. Eric Pickles, previously the Communities Secretary left the Cabinet and received a knighthood, being replaced by Greg Clark. Michael Gove moved to the position of Justice Secretary, replacing Chris Grayling, who became the new Leader of the House of Commons.
Several vacant Cabinet posts previously held by Liberal Democrats were subsequently filled by Conservative ministers - the positions of Business Secretary, Energy Secretary, Scottish Secretary and Chief Secretary to the Treasury were given to Sajid Javid, Amber Rudd, David Mundell and Greg Hands respectively, with John Whittingdale replacing Javid as Culture Secretary.
Mark Harper replaced Gove as Chief Whip, whilst Matthew Hancock became the new Minister for the Cabinet Office, being replaced by Anna Soubry as Minister of State for Small Business, Industry and Enterprise. Also Priti Patel became the new Minister of State for Employment and Robert Halfon became a Minister without Portfolio.
