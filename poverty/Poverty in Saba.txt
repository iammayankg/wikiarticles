== EconomyEdit ==
Pecans emerged as an important crop, largely because of the work of Edmund E. Risien, an Englishman who moved to San Saba County in 1874 and made improvement of the native nuts his life's work. Risien founded the West Texas Pecan Nursery at the junction of the San Saba and Colorado Rivers. The "Mother Pecan Tree", located in the heart of this orchard, has been used to produce many great pecan varieties. Some of these include the: San Saba Improved, Texas Prolific,Onliwon, Squirrel Delight, No.60, and Western Schley and these are just a few of the varieties this tree has produced. During his era, his customer base included Queen Victoria of England, Lord Alfred Tennyson and the cereal company giant, C.W. Post. Today, Risien is credited for laying the groundwork for the pecan industry that led San Saba County to proclaim itself 'Pecan Capital of the World'. Today the land and orchard is owned by the Millican family and six generations have worked in the pecan business.
