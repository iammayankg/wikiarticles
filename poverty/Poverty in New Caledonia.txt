== History ==
The Seneca Indians had a village in this area called Canawaugus (or Conawagus); however, this village was located on the Genesee River and was closer to Avon, NY. Chief Cornplanter was born here around 1750.
The first white settlements occurred around 1795, but the first known permanent settlement began in 1797. The Town of Caledonia was established in 1803 as the "Town of Southampton," having previously been known as "Northampton." It assumed its current name in 1806 due to the influence of settlers from Scotland. Part of Caledonia was used to form the town of Bellona in 1812 whose name changed to the Town of Le Roy (Genesee County) in 1813, and in 1819, another part of Caledonia was removed to form part of the Town of York. The Town of Wheatland (Monroe County) was formed from Caledonia in 1821.
The Caledonia House Hotel and Clark-Keith House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
