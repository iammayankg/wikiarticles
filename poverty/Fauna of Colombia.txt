The fauna of Colombia is characterized by a high biodiversity, with the highest rate of species by area unit worldwide.


== Endemism ==
Colombia has the largest number of endemic species (species that are not found naturally anywhere else) worldwide. About 10% of the species in the world live in Colombia. Some determinant factors In the distribution range of the species are the weather conditions, temperature, humidity and sunlight availability.
Endemics can easily become endangered or extinct due to their restricted habitat and vulnerability to the actions of man, including the introduction of new organisms.


=== Ecoregions with high endemism ===
According to the Colombian Ministry of Environment, the following ecoregions have the highest percentage of endemic species:
Cocora valley (Quindío)
Serranía de la Macarena (Meta Department)
Gorgona, Colombia (island in the Pacific Ocean)
Amacayacu National Park (Amazonas Department)

=== The national bird ===

The Andean condor inhabits the Andes mountain range. Although it is primarily a scavenger, feeding on carrion, this species belongs to the New World vulture family Cathartidae.
The condor is one of the largest birds on earth with a wingspan ranging from 274–310 cm (108–122 in) and weighting up to 11–15 kg (24–33 lb) for males and 7.5–11 kg (16–24 lb) for females, but overall length can range from 117 to 135 cm (46 to 53 inches).
The adult plumage is of a uniform black, with the exception of a frill of white feathers nearly surrounding the base of the neck and, especially in the male, large patches or bands of white on the wings which do not appear until the completion of the first moulting.he live in amazon rain forest in brasil of Colombians people he live from 1 to 30 years more than a mammal he was so potent and was his mammal he live to in Asia and Africa.


== Mammals ==

There are 456 reported species of mammals in Colombia. Of these, about 22% are endangered or critically endangered. Most of the threatened species status are due to human activities, in particular destruction of plant and animal habitats driven by local consumption of organic resources, especially related to tropical forest destruction.
While most of the species that are becoming extinct are not food species, their biomass is converted into human food when their habitat is transformed into pasture and cropland.
Colombia has the largest number of terrestrial mammals species in the world, including among others:

Colombian woolly monkey
Colombian black-handed titi
Coppery titi
Lucifer titi
Black titi
Collared titi

== Amphibians ==

Colombia has the largest number of amphibians in the world (including frogs, toads, salamanders and caecilians) with 208 endangered species, being the zoological group with the highest rate of endangerment. Some causes related with the decline of the amphibians are: chytridiomycosis, habitat destruction, drought, air pollution, water pollution and illegal trade.
