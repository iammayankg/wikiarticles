Nariño (Spanish pronunciation: [naˈɾiɲo]) is a department of Colombia named after Antonio Nariño. Its capital is San Juan de Pasto. It is in the west of the country, bordering Ecuador and the Pacific Ocean.
Nariño has a diverse geography and varied climate according to altitude: hot in the plains of the Pacific and cold in the mountains, where most of the population resides, a situation that is repeated in a north-south direction. Other important cities include Tumaco and Ipiales.


== History ==
The territory was occupied during the Pre-Columbian era by numerous Indian tribes, including Quillacingas, Awa and Tumas. The first conqueror who was entering the territory was Andagoya Pascual in 1522, who traveled from the Colombian Pacific coast and then used information obtained by Francisco Pizarro to organize the expedition that culminated in the conquest of Peru.
Juan de Ampudia and Pedro de Añazco first explored the mountainous part of the department, commissioned by Sebastian de Belalcazar in 1535, who then toured the territory in 1536 and reached Popayán and remained for some time before leaving for Spain.
