Orphans of the Sahara is a three-part documentary series, produced by Al Jazeera, and aired on January 2014.
Series follows the story of the Tuareg people of the Sahara desert, from their involvement in war in Libya, fighting for Muammar Gaddafi, to their return home to crushing poverty in Mali and Niger, then as they launched a Tuareg Rebellion of 2012 for an independent country in the Sahara, Azawad. As the Northern Mali conflict escalated their dreams were crushed once again, first by al-Qaeda, then by French military intervention in Mali and Niger, with a help of military coalitions established by EU nations and US.
