The economy of the Faroe Islands was the 166th largest in the world in 2014, having a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) of $2.613 billion per annum.
After the severe economic troubles of the early 1990s, brought on by a drop in the vital fish catch and poor management of the economy, the Faroe Islands have come back in the last few years, with unemployment down to 5% in mid-1998, and holding below 3% since 2006, one of the lowest rates in Europe. Nevertheless, the almost total dependence on fishing means the economy remains extremely vulnerable. The Faroese hope to broaden their economic base by building new fish-processing plants. Petroleum found close to the Faroese area gives hope for deposits in the immediate area, which may lay the basis to sustained economic prosperity. Also important are the annual subsidy from Denmark, which amounts to about 3% of the GDP.
Since 2000, new information technology and business projects have been fostered in the Faroe Islands to attract new investment. The result from these projects is not yet known but is hoped to bring a better market economy to the Faroe Islands.
The Faroes have one of the lowest unemployment rates in Europe, but this is not necessarily a sign of a recovering economy, as many young students move to Denmark and other countries once they are finished with high school. This leaves a largely middle-aged and elderly population that may lack the skills and knowledge to take IT positions on the Faroes.


== Other statistics ==
24.6% of the import from European Union countries were imported from Denmark in 2013, 10% were imported from Germany. 11.3% of the export to EU countries in 2013 were exported to the UK, 6.8% were exported to Denmark.


== Electricity and heating ==
The islands have a goal of 100% green electricity production by 2030.
In 2014, a 12MW wind farm for DKK 180 million became operational near Torshavn and increased wind capacity from 6.6 to 18.6MW. It decreases oil consumption by 8,000 ton (approximately 4M€) per year. There are plans to connect a 2.3MW Lithium-ion battery, and planners also consider converting the existing hydropower to Pumped-storage hydroelectricity. Tidal power and Thermal energy storage solutions are also considered.


=== Electricity - production by source ===
The islands have 6 hydroelectric plants, 4 diesel plants and several wind power plants with a capacity factor above 40%.
In 2014 50.8% of the electricity production of SEV in the Faroe Islands came from green energy like hydro and wind, while 49.2% was produced by the thermal power plants, which was 12.4% less than in 2013.
fossil fuel: 49.2%
hydro: 39.5%
wind: 11.3%% (2014)
nuclear: 0%


=== Electricity - Total annual production ===
Total annual production: 305.4 GWh (2014) of which the production of thermal, hydropower and wind power was:
Thermal: 150,2 GWh
Hydropower: 120,7 GWh
Wind: 34,5 GWh
The Faroe Islands have no electricity connections to other areas, and thus operate in island condition. Some islands are also not connected to the other islands, and must maintain their own electric system.
Electricity - exports: 0 kWh (2010)
Electricity - imports: 0 kWh (2010)


== Other ==
Agriculture - products: milk, potatoes, vegetables; sheep; salmon, other fish
Currency: 1 Danish krone (DKr) = 100 ører
Exchange rates: Danish kroner (DKr) per US$1 – 5.560 (2008), 7.336 (January 2000), 6.976 (1999), 6.701 (1998), 6.604 (1997), 5.799 (1996), 5.602 (1995)
