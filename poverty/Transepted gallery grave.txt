A transepted gallery grave is a type of megalithic chamber tombs built across Atlantic Europe during the Neolithic period.
Such graves have burial monuments with side rooms extending laterally from a central chamber. They are found at sites in the Loire valley of France, south west Great Britain and in Ireland and it is thought the builders had cultural links with one another.
