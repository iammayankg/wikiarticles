The House of Representatives (Spanish: CÃ¡mara de Representantes) is the lower house of the Congress of Colombia.
The House of Representatives has 166 elected members for four-year terms.


== How the House is elected ==
According to the Colombian Constitution, every department is an electoral administrative division. There are also four special circumscriptions: One for Indian communities, one for Afro-Colombian communities (negritudes), one for other minorities and one for Colombian citizens abroad, which have become lately a much-courted political group.
There will be two representatives for each territorial circumscription, and every territorial circumscription will elect an additional member for every 250,000 residents or fraction greater than 125,000 residents in excess of the first 250,000 residents. The Afro-Colombian circunscription elects two representatives, and the Indian, other minority and expatriate circumscriptions elect one each.
