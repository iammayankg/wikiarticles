Global warming in Belgium describes the global warming related issues in Belgium.


== Emissions ==
In 1990, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were 146.9 million tons of CO2 equivalent (Mt CO2 eq), whose 88 million tons came from the Flemish Region, 54.8 from the Walloon Region and 4 Mt from the Brussels-capital Region.


== Agreements ==
Being a member of the European Union, Belgium, applied the European Union Emission Trading Scheme set up by the Directive 2003/87/EC. The Kyoto protocol sets a 7.5% reduction of greenhouse gas emission target compared to 1990. Belgium set up a National Allocation Plan at the federal level with target for each of the three regions.
On 14 November 2002, Belgium signed the Cooperation Agreement for the implementation of a National Climate Plan and reporting in the context of the UNFCCC and the Kyoto protocol. The first National Allocation Plan was for the period from 2005 to 2007. The European commission approved it on 20 October 2004. The second allocation plan was for the period 2008-2012 and aims a reduction of 7.5% of greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990.


=== Flemish Region ===
The target of the Flemish Region is a reduction of 5.2% of GHG in the period 2008-2012 compared to 1990. That means an average emissions of 83,436 million tons CO2 equivalent in the 2008-2012 period. The 2008-2012, Flemish allocation plan deals with installation consuming more than 0.5 PJ (139 GWh) annually. 17% of GHG emissions comes from transportation and 21 from electricity production and heat production (excluded heat for buildings). There are 178 installations listed.
The largest emitter are with the value in MTon CO2 equivalent per year:
Sidmar owned by ArcelorMittal in Ghent: 8,918,495
Total refinery in Antwerp: 4,323,405
BASF in Antwerp: 2,088,422
Zandvliet Power, a joint venture of BASF and GDF Suez, in Zandvliet: 1,119,158
Esso refinery in Antwerp: 1,933,000
Fina Olefins in Antwerp: 1,414,550
Electrabel in Herdersbrug: 990,397
Electrabel in Drogenbos: 998,794
E.ON Benelux in Vilvoorde: 828,920
SPE in Ringvaarts: 807,066
Electrabel in Ruien: 730,332
E.ON Benelux in Langerloo: 586,961
Degussa in Antwerp: 526,949


=== Brussels-Capital Region ===
Being a federal state, Brussels-Capital Region also made a second allocation plan for 2008–2012 based on the decree of June 3, 2004 that implements the European directive 2003/87/CE. In that plan, Brussels objective is to have an increase of maximum 3,475% of greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990.
In 2004, the Brussels-Capital Region emitted 4.4 million tons CO2 equivalent, an increase of 9% compared to 1990 when emissions were 4,083 MTons CO2 eq. The emissions come from domestic use (45%), tertiary sector (25%) and transportation (19%), and energy/industry (2%). The 4.4 MTons CO2 eq do not take into account GHG emission due to electricity production outside the region.
The 2008–2012 allocation plans include only eight facilities:
Audi (former Volkswagen plant) auto production plant in Forest
a BNP Paribas facility (former Fortis)
Bruda plant producing Asphalt
Electrabel turbo-jet power plant in Schaarbeek
Electrabel turbo-jet power plant at Buda
Electrabel turbo-jet power plant owned at Volta
an RTBF television facility
World Trade Center building


=== Walloon Region ===
In the second allocation plan (for the period 2008-2012), the Walloon Region is planning a reduction of 7.5% of GHG emissions compared to 1990 when 54.84 million tons CO2 equivalent was emitted. 
The plan for 2008-2012 includes 172 premises. In 2005, the largest emitter were (number in tons CO2 equivalent):
CCB cement plant in Gaurain-Ramecroix: 1,515,543
Holcim cement plant in Obourg: 1,508,060
Electrabel power plant in Monceau: 1,260,520
CBR cement plant in Lixhe: 1,059,929
Dumont Wautier Lime plant in Saint Georges: 1,294,087
Other large emitter are cast iron and steel producer in Charleroi and Liège.
On October 22, 2009, BASF announced that they will close the plant located at Feluy at the end of 2009. That plant had a yearly allocation of 36,688 tons of CO2 equivalent.
